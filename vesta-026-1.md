**Water Leak Sensor (WLS-23)**

**Introduction**

WLS-23 is a Water Leak Sensor. It is capable of sending wireless signals to the Control Panel upon water detection. The Water Sensor can be placed on the ground, or mounted on the wall using the extension cable to detect water leakage or flood condition. The Water Sensing Cable and built-in water sensing probes can detect water leakage or flood condition. It can be placed on the ground, or mounted on the wall and further extended by connecting to another water sensing cable to improve detection range.

**The Water Leak Sensor includes the following frequency models:**

**433FM F1**

**868FM F1**

* _**Water Detection**_
  * The Water Sensor will be activated when water is detected through:
    1. The **external water sensing cable or water probe cable**

Please remove the pre-installed plastic plug from the external water probe connector, the Water Sensor will emit beep sound every 10 seconds to indicate absence of plastic plug, please connect the external water probe to the connector (Refer to _**Mounting**_ for details).

*
  *
    1. The **built-in water sensing probe**.

Please make sure the plastic plug is well inserted when using this type of detection function. (Refer to _**Mounting**_ for details).

*
  * If water is detected through the above two detecting methods, the Water Sensor will start alarming and will transmit an alarm signal to the Control Panel.
  * If water persists, the Water Sensor will continue alarming and send alarm signal every 2 minutes.
  * If water is subsided, the Water Sensor will stop alarming and transmit a restore signal.

* ![](<.gitbook/assets/3 (35).png>)_**Alarm Silence**_
  * Press the Function button once to enter Alarm Silence mode while alarming.
  * Under Alarm Silence mode, the Water Sensor will not sound alarm.
  * After the water leak condition is restored, the sensor detects the water leak again, it will sound alarm.
* _**Battery and Low Battery Detection**_
  * The Water Sensor uses one CR123 3V Lithium battery as its power source.
  * The Water Sensor features Low Battery Detection function. When the battery voltage is low, the Water Sensor will transmit Low Battery signal to the Control Panel.
  * When under Low Battery status, the LED will flash every 4 seconds to remind the user to insert a new battery.
  * The Low Battery signal will not disappear until a new battery is inserted.
  * When changing battery, after removing the old battery, press the Function Button twice to fully discharge before inserting a new battery.
* _**Supervision**_
  * The Water Sensor will transmit a supervision signal to report its condition regularly according to user setting. The factory default interval is 30 minutes. The user can also press the Function Button once to transmit a supervision signal manually.
* _**Getting Started**_
  * Remove the battery insulator to power on the Water Sensor.
  * Put your Control Panel into learning mode (Please refer to your Control Panel manual for details).
  * Press the Learn/Test button once to transmit a learn code to the Control Panel, the LED will flash 3 times to indicate.
  * If the Control Panel receives the learn code, it will display the information accordingly, refer to the Control Panel manual to complete the learning process. You can start Mounting process

* _**Mounting**_

There are two ways to mount the Water Sensor:

*
  * **Wall mounting (use the external water sensing probe):**
    1. Choose to install the Water Sensor at a desirable height
    2. Drill hole in the surface.
    3. Insert the screw into the hole.
    4. Hook the Water Sensor onto the screw using the Mounting Hook behind the device.
    5. The external water probe connector is pre-installed with a **plastic plug** (**Fig.1**), please remove it.
    6. Connect the enclosed water sensing probe to the external water probe connector.
  * **Ground surface mounting (use the built-in water sensing probes):**

\- Simply place your Water Sensor at the desirable location on the ground. - Do NOT place on conductive surface.

* _**Water Sensing Cable**_

A Water Sensing Cable or Water Probe Cable is available for selection. The cable can be further extended by connecting to another cable to improve detection range.

| **Water Sensing Cable**  | **Water Probe Cable** |   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | - |
| **(earphone jack type)** |                       |   |
| **(earphone jack type)** |                       |   |

**User Guidelines**

* When water is detected through the Water Sensing Cable or Water Sensing Probe, the Water Sensor will start alarming and transmit an alarm signal to the Control Panel.
* Upon receiving an alert notification from the Control Panel, unplug the Water Sensing Cable.
* Use a towel to dry the Water Sensing Cable.

![](<.gitbook/assets/11 (14).jpeg>)

* It is recommended to air dry residual water in a ventilated place for at least two hours before inserting the sensing cable.

_**\<NOTE>**_

* Avoid direct or indirect sunshine.
* Improper storage can cause damage to the sensor and the cable.
