**3. Power Supply**

A DC 9V 1A SPS power adapter is provided for AC power connection.

In addition to the AC power adapter, a rechargeable battery is installed inside VCP-LTE-SV to serve as a backup in case of a power failure.

You need to switch the battery switch to ON for the battery to be charged when AC power is connected and serve as a backup power source when AC power is missing.
