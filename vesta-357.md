<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (14) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

VST-892EX-BUS is a wired outdoor passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor camera. It is capable of sending wired signals and captured images (picture quality of up to 640 x 480 pixels) over BUS to the Control Panel upon movement detection.

Featuring night illumination capability, with a UV resistant housing, and waterproof to IPX6 standard, VST-892EX-BUS is ideal for backyards, lawns, gates, outdoor corridors and hallways.

The outdoor PIR Camera is designed with a typical detection range of 10 meters when mounted at a height of 2.3 meters above the ground. It provides pet-immunity for pets of up to 60 kilos with three selectable sensitivity levels to adapt to different environments.

In addition, VST-892EX-BUS is designed with the digital proximity detector. The anti-masking feature allows for detection of any attempts to blind the detector by placing objects in its field of view.

Remote configuration is supported for the PIR motion sensor camera. Besides adjusting the DIP Switch, users can also enable/disable the double knock function and pet immunity, and adjust the sensitivity of the PIR Camera from the Control Panel webpage or Home Portal Server.

{% endhint %}

* The LED indicator can be enabled by setting the DIP Switch 2 to ON position. Please refer to **DIP Switch Position Table** below for details.

## _**Image Capture**_

When the alarm system is armed, the PIR Camera will capture 1, 3 or 6 alarm images with resolution of 640 x 480 or 320 x 240 (programmable from the Control Panel) upon movement detection. You can also manually request the PIR Camera to take a picture through the Control Panel. The captured images will be transferred to the Control Panel for visual alarm verification.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

If your PIR Camera is installed at a location where the camera’s field of view is a complex environment with intense light or lots of colors, the images captured will be great in file size, possibly leading to truncation when the images are transmitted to the Control Panel.
{% endhint %}

## _**Warm Up Period**_

The PIR Camera will warm up for 60 seconds when the PIR Camera is turned on by the Control Panel upon entering armed mode.

## _**Test Mode**_

* The PIR Camera can be put into Test mode for 10 minutes by pressing the test button once.
* In Test Mode, the image capture functions are disabled. The LED indicator will flash once whenever a movement is detected.
* The PIR Camera will automatically exit Test Mode after 10 minutes and return to normal mode.
* In Test Mode, the LED indicator must be enabled by setting the DIP Switch 2 to ON position, and the Double Knock function must be disabled by setting the DIP Switch 7 to OFF position, for the users to test the detection range.

## _**Double Knock Function**_

* The PIR Camera has a double knock function. If the double knock function is enabled, the PIR Camera will report an alarm to the control panel only if two movements are detected within 10 seconds. If the double knock function is disabled, the PIR Camera will report an alarm to the Control Panel when a movement is detected.

## _**DIP Switch Position Table**_

The function of each DIP Switch is listed in the table below. The DIP Switch is either ON or OFF. Top position indicates ON, and bottom position indicates OFF.

## _**Supervision Signal**_

* After installation, the PIR Camera will automatically transmit Supervisory signals periodically to the Control Panel at random intervals of 20-30 seconds.

## _**Tamper Protection**_

* The PIR Camera is protected by an internal tamper switch which is compressed when the PIR Camera is hooked onto the mounting bracket. When the PIR Camera is removed from the mounting bracket, the tamper switch will be activated and the PIR Camera will send a tamper open signal to the control panel to remind the user of this condition.

## _**Anti-Masking**_

* The PIR Camera has a digital proximity detector that can detect any masking (blocking) attempts by an intruder.
* When a masking event is detected, and the masking condition lasts for 3 minutes, VST-892EX-BUS will send a masking alarm signal to the Control Panel to notify user of the masking condition.
* After masking/blocking is removed for 3 minutes, VST-892EX-BUS will send a restore signal to the Control Panel.

## _**Power Supply**_

* When VST-892EX-BUS is hardwired to a Hybrid Panel, 13.5V power supply can be provided by the Hybrid Panel.

{% hint style="danger" %}
_**Caution**_&#x20;

* Wiring of the PIR camera should only be performed by certified technicians with proper knowledge and training in electric equipment.
* Before installation or any maintenance work, make sure the power supply has been disconnected.
{% endhint %}

## _**Outdoor PIR Camera Wiring**_

* Before connecting the PIR Camera to the system bus, please switch the power off.
* To assist with cable connections, the terminal blocks on each BUS system module are color-coded.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/10 (90).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Multiple BUS devices can be connected in series to the Hybrid Panel. For optimal communication of the connected BUS line devices, ensure the terminal resistor jumper switches of the first (usually the Hybrid Panel) and the furthest BUS devices on a BUS line are set to ON to serve as terminating resistors. Be sure to only enable the aforementioned 2 jumper switches, and do not set the jumper switches to ON for any other BUS devices in between.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

The pluggable design of BUS terminal blocks improves upon installation efficiency. Before wiring, you can remove the terminal blocks from the PCB board for ease of use, and plug in again after wiring.

After unplugging the terminal, when re-installing the terminal back to the board, make sure to install the terminal in the same direction to avoid potential hazards
{% endhint %}

* Incorrect connections will result in failure or improper operation. Inspect wiring and ensure proper connections before applying power.

* _**Installation Recommendations**_

**It is recommended installing the PIR Camera in the following locations:**

* At a height of 2.3 meters (measured from the bottom of the camera) above the ground level for best performance
* In a corner for the widest view
* At a place where an intruder would normally move across the PIR Camera’s field of view
* On a surface or in a corner where animals are inaccessible
* The PIR Camera has a detection range of 10 meters when mounted at the height of 2.3 meters above the ground.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/10 (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Limitations:**

* Do not expose the PIR Camera completely to direct sunlight.
* Avoid large obstacles in the detection area.
* Do not face heat sources such as fires and boilers, directly or install above radiators.
* Never attempt to disassemble or modify the device.
* Please install the PIR Camera straight up. Do not tilt it.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/10 (6) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Do not install the motion sensor camera where objects are moved by the wind, such as trees and laundry, which may block the motion sensor camera’s field of view.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/10 (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Clear all light-reflecting surfaces from the detection area, as well as water puddles.

{% hint style="danger" %}
_IMPORTANT NOTE_

* Adjust the Dip Switches according to the installation location of the PIR Camera for ideal performance. If the Dip Switch settings does not match with the installation environment, the PIR Camera’s performance will be hindered and may cause either false alarm or inability to detect movement.
* The PIR Camera detects differences between the moving object and the background. If the object is idle (i.e., not moving), the PIR Camera is unable to detect it.
* The PIR Camera has a directional characteristic and is most effective at detecting intruders moving across its field of detection. It is less sensitive for detecting motions directly in front of the PIR Camera.
* For best performance, remember to adjust the mounting height of the motion sensor camera with respect to the height of the tallest pet in the house. Taller dogs require the motion sensor camera to be mounted higher for pet friendliness.
* The PIR Camera has a blind spot of about 1 meter under the camera when mounted at a height of 2.3 meters. The blind spot area will enlarge if the PIR Camera is mounted higher than the height of 2.3 meters, and reduce if mounted lower than this height.
* Unless required, it is suggested keeping the PIR Camera’s mounting location at the height of 2.3 meters for optimum performance. If you change the mounting height, please conduct detection test to make sure the PIR Camera can normally detect intruders at the chosen height.
