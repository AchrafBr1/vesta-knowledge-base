**1. Tamper Switch**

The Tamper switch will be activated when the Bellbox is removed from mounted surface, or when its cover is opened.

**2. Battery Compartment**

The Bellbox is powered by two 1.5V D-Cell alkaline batteries.

3. **Battery Switch**
4. **Wall Mounting Holes x 3**
5. **Learn Button**
6. **LED 3, 2, 1 (From Left to Right)**

**Accessories included**

In addition to the Bell Box itself, the following accessories are also included in the package:

3 x large wall plugs.

3 x fixing screws for wall mounting

2 x 1.5V D alkaline batteries (pre-inserted)

## **Battery and Low Battery Detection**

The Bellbox is powered by 2 1.5V Alkaline D batteries, it features low battery detection and will transmit low battery signal when low battery voltage is detected.

When changing batteries, after removing the old battery, press the Tamper Switch a couple times to fully discharge before inserting new battery

## **Supervision**

The Bellbox will transmit a supervisory signal every 30-50 minutes in normal operation mode. If this signal is not received, the Control Panel will indicate that the particular Bellbox is experiencing an out-of-order problem.

## **Function Overview**

### **Alarm Memory**

If an alarm was triggered in your absence and the system was not disarmed before alarm length expiry, the Bellbox will sound a short alarm when the system is disarmed to warn the user that an alarm has been triggered when he is away. This suggests that the intruder could still be within the premises.

### **Alarm Length**

When an alarm is activated by Control Panel, the Control Panel will notify the Bellbox to start alarming according to the panel’s own alarm length setting. When the Panel’s alarm length expires, it will notify the Bellbox to stop alarm.

If the Bellbox does not receive the Control Panel’s signal to stop alarm, it will sound alarm for a maximum of 3 minutes, then stop the alarm. For example:

* If the Panel alarm length is set more than 3 minutes, after an alarm is activated, instead of waiting panel alarm length to expire, the Bellbox will stop alarming after 3 minutes.
* If the panel is under disarm mode and the Bellbox tamper switch is triggered, the Bellbox will activate alarm for 3 minutes since the panel is under disarm mode and will not activate alarm from tamper trigger.

### **Siren Tamper**

The Bellbox is protected against any attempt to open the lid or to detach the bellbox from its mounting surface.

If the Bellbox detects a tamper condition, it will activate the siren & strobe light for the programmed alarm period. A tamper signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular signal transmissions for the Control Panel to display the status accordingly. If the tamper condition persists, the Bellbox will sound a series of five beeps either every time the system is armed or when the tamper is enabled, to indicate a fault.

Tamper feature can be disabled temporaily from the Control Panel using Siren Tamper control function. The Bellbox will stop tamper detection temporarity for one hour. This function is mainly designed for replacing battery or changing Bellbox installation location. After one hour, The Control Panel will automatically turn the function back ON after the duration. The tamper detection can also be enabled again manually using the Siren Tamper function.

### **Audio & Visual Status Indication**

While arming / disarming the system, the Bellbox uses different methods to distinguish various statuses for the user, as listed in the table.

<table><thead><tr><th width="207"></th><th width="190">Siren Audio</th><th width="279">Strobe light indication</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Arm/Home</td><td>1 beep*</td><td>3 LED groups flash once</td></tr><tr><td>Disarm</td><td>2 beeps*</td><td>Sequentially flashes for 1 cycle</td></tr><tr><td>Arm (Low Battery)</td><td>3 beeps</td><td>3 LED groups flash for three times</td></tr><tr><td>Disarm (Low Battery)</td><td>3 beeps</td><td>Sequentially flashes for 3 cycles</td></tr><tr><td>Arm (Tamper)</td><td>5 beeps</td><td>3 LED groups flash for 5 times</td></tr><tr><td>Disarm (Tamper)</td><td>5 beeps</td><td>Sequentially flashes for 5 cycles</td></tr><tr><td>Entry/Exit Sound</td><td>Count-down beeps</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table>

* The Siren Audio indication will be affected by the Confirmation ON / OFF setting. When setting Confirmation to OFF, the confirmation sound will not be available. Refer to Control Panel Sound/Siren setting for Confirmation function.
