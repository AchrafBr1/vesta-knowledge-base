### INTRUDUCTION

VESTA wired detectors represent the best choice for residential and industrial installations in the security sector. It use only digital PIRs, thus avoiding the conversion that generally must be done in traditional detectors, where the analog PIR is amplified and converted to digital. Thanks to the TOTALLY digital technology, the detector is much more accurate in detecting intrusions and not suffering of alterations such as: white light, ultraviolet light, temperature, air movement due to heating/cooling systems and it is totally immune to radiated and conducted electromagnetic disturbances. ProLine detectors are equipped with lenses designed by AMC and made by Fresnel Technologies, Inc. LODIFF® technology for optics realization in combination with POLY IR® materials make it a product with highest quality and efficiency. All ProLine detectors are pet immune with range of 15 mt, with 100 degrees angle. The sensor is equipped with latest generation microwave modules, with very low background noise, and can be supplied with different frequencies in compliance with the legislation of the individual countries.

### INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

* By using a thin screwdriver, loosen the screw on the bottom and open the housing (see figure 1)
* Remove the PCB from the base by levering on the ABS supports (see figure 2)
* Pierce the knock on the base of cover on the desired point for fixing (or use the optional swivel bracket not certified IMQ)
* Pierce the kconck on the base and fix a screw between wall and cover for back tamper protection (see fig2)
* recommended height from 1.8mt to 2,2mt
* slide the cable into the back seat, and out of the top hole
* Wire up the terminals following the connections shown in figure.

### LED FUNCTIONS

During normal operation:

* <mark style="color:green;">**GREEN LED**</mark>: PIR Alarm
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**YELLOW LED**</mark>: MW Alarm
* <mark style="color:blue;">**BLUE LED**</mark>: General Alarm (PIR and MW)
* AM VERSION: in case of masking, the LED corresponding to the masked technology flashes with the opening the alarm contacts with MASK contact AM version (antimasking version) The AM version provides a continuous self test, in case of anomaly lasting more than 15 seconds the sensor will report the folowing signaling:
* POWER SUPPLY BEYOND THE NOMINAL THRESHOLDS : Alternative flashing of yellow and green led with Mask contact opened
* PIR FILED SELF-TEST green led flashing with opened MASK contact
* MW filed SELF-TEST Yellow led flashing with opened MASK contact



### ADJUSTMENT AND CONECTION

Dip 1--> off = led off - on = led on\*

Dip 2 --> off = 15mt - on =7mt range&#x20;

Dip 3 --> off =1 pulse - on = 2 pulse&#x20;

Dip 4 - 5 --> OFF-OFF = AND ON-OFF=OR ON-ON=AUTO OR\*&#x20;

Trimmer Range = used only for MW&#x20;

Jumpers T - A - EOL open = all contact Free without resistors&#x20;

Jumpers T - A - EOL closed = double balancing (see below values)&#x20;

ALARM: terminals NC (EOL jumper opened)&#x20;

Tamper: terminals NC (EOL jumper opened)&#x20;

MASK: terminal NC (with EOL jumper opened -only for AM version)&#x20;

BS: terminal for remote LED control and MW&#x20;

DT2AM + and - = SUPPLY: power supply 9 - 15Vcc @ 27 mA nominal
