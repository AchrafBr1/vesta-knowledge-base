WTRVS-15-FS is a small and lightweight Voice Reach Talking Pendant. The pendant allows immediate post-alarm voice follow up after an emergency call or fall detection. With a simple press of the button, it can open two-way voice communication channel between the user and the Central Monitoring Station.

The Voice Reach Talking Pendant provides high-clarity two-way communication via Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) protocol. The device also has power saving feature for the panel by adopting RF technology to transmit periodic supervisory signals and low battery signal and to the Panel.

## **Learning**

Step 1. Please refer to the Control Panel manual and put the Control Panel into **Learning Mode**.

Step 2. Press and hold the Active Button for 8 seconds until you hear a long beep. The LED will turn on orange and the Talking Pendant will emit 1 long beep to indicate it is now in learning mode. Wait for a short time to complete learning.

Step 3. If learning is successful, the Green LED will turn on 3 seconds and the pendant will emit 2 beeps.

If learning fails, the LED will dim and the pendant will emit 1 long beep.

Step 4. Refer to Control Panel manual to complete learning process.

## **Battery**

* The Talking Pendant uses one CR123 3V lithium battery as its power source.
* The Talking Pendant will automatically check its battery condition every 24 hours. If low battery voltage is detected, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with Supervisory Signals every 30 to 50 minutes.

## **To Change Battery:**

**Step 1:** Remove the battery compartment cover.

**Step 2:** Remove the old battery by pulling the black strip.
