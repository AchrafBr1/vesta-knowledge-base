* _**Parts Identification**_
  1. _**Dual Color LED (Amber & Red)**_
     * When the battery voltage is low, the Amber LED will flash every 45 seconds.
     * When any fault condition is detected by self-diagnostics test, the Amber LED will flash every 5 seconds.
     * While the Carbon Monoxide Detector is transmitting signal, the RED LED will flash
     * While Carbon Monoxide is alarming, the Red LED will flash quickly.
     * During Alarm Silence, the Red LED will flash once every second.
     * When battery is exhausted, both the Red LED and the Amber LED will flash once every 4 seconds.
  2. _**Learn/Test Button**_

![](<.gitbook/assets/4 (67).png>)

*
  * 3 “**AA**” 1.5V alkaline batteries are used to supply power.
  * The Carbon Monoxide Detector has a battery life of approximately 9 years.
  * When Carbon Monoxide Detector detects low battery voltage, a low battery signal will be transmitted along with regular signal transmissions. The Amber LED will flash and the Carbon Monoxide Detector will emit a beep every 30 seconds.
  * When the battery is exhausted, remove the battery compartment cover and replace with new batteries.
* _**Supervision**_
  * After installation, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will automatically transmit Supervisory Signals to the Control Panel at random intervals of 30 to 50 minutes.
  * If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Carbon Monoxide Detector for a preset period of time, the Control Panel will determine the Carbon Monoxide Detector has failed supervision and is out-of-order.

  * The alarm will be activated after CO concentration is detected according to time length in following table:

| **CO concentration** | **Time taken before** |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| **level**            | **alarming**          |
|                      |                       |
| 30 ppm               | N/A                   |
|                      |                       |
| 50 ppm               | 60\~90 minutes        |
|                      |                       |
| 100 ppm              | 10\~40 minutes        |
|                      |                       |
| 300 ppm              | Under 3 minutes       |
|                      |                       |

*
  * Once the alarm is activated, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will transmit alarm signal and activate its buzzer to raise alarm. The Red LED will begin to flash rapidly.
  * After alarm activation, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will continue to sound alarm and resend alarm signal every 2 minutes until the CO concentration drops below 30 ppm. When the concentration drops below 30 ppm, the carbon Monoxide Detector will stop sounding alarm and transmit a restore signal.
* _**Alarm Silence**_
  * When the alarm is sounding, pressing the Test button will put the Carbon Monoxide Detector into Alarm Silence mode for 10 minutes and the alarm will be stopped temporarily.
  * After this 10-min period is over, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will check the Carbon Monoxide concentration again. If the Carbon Monoxide concentration is still over the set threshold value, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will sound the warning alarm again. If not, it will return to normal operation mode and transmit restore signal.
* _**Self-diagnostics**_

![](<.gitbook/assets/7 (44).png>) ![](<.gitbook/assets/8 (44).png>)

The Carbon Monoxide Detector will perform self-diagnostics every 12 hours. The user can also press and hold the test button for 10 seconds to perform self-diagnostics. If any fault is detected, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will transmit signal to the Control Panel, and the Amber LED will flash every 5 seconds. The following three conditions of Carbon Monoxide Sensor can be detected via self-diagnostics.

| **Condition**                                       | **Description**                                              | **Report to Control Panel** |   |

* _**Learning**_

Step 1 Insert the 3 “**AA**” batteries into the battery compartment according to correct polarity shown on the battery holder.

Step 2 When the batteries are inserted, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will sound 2 short beeps, and the Red LED will flash once.

Step 3 Put the Control Panel into **Learning** mode, refer to Control Panel manual for detail. Step 4 Press the Learn/Test Button on the Carbon Monoxide Detector to transmit signal to the

Control Panel for learn-in process. The Red LED will flash once with a beep.

Step 5 Refer to the operation manual to finish learning process.

* _**Walk Test**_

Test the Carbon Monoxide Detector signal range using the Walk Test function.

Step 1 Put the Control Panel into Walk Test mode. Refer to panel manual for detail.

Step 2 Press the Learn/Test button to transmit a signal. The Red LED will flash once with a beep. If the Red LED does not flash and no beep is heard, it means the detector is out of order or the

2

battery has exhausted.

Step 3 If the Control Panel successfully receives the signal, it will display device signal strength accordingly. Exit Walk Test mode to complete test. If the signal is not received, it means the panel is outside Carbon Monoxide detector signal range. Please relocate the detector and try again.

* _**Installation Guideline**_

It is recommended to install the Carbon Monoxide Detector in following locations.

* Install the Carbon Monoxide Detector in your bedrooms to protect your safety.
* For houses with garage, also mount near the internal door to garage and the room above the garage for protection in case when car engin is not turned off.

![](<.gitbook/assets/12 (23).jpeg>)

*
  * Inside kitchen and garage – to avoid false alarm
  * Corner or location with stagnant air – to avoid false alarm
  * Fireplace – Keep at least 4.5 meters of distance to avoid false alarm.
* _**Installation**_

![](<.gitbook/assets/13 (29).png>)

(It is recommended that CO-8 should be installed by a competent person).

A mounting bracket is provided in the package for mounting the Carbon Monoxide Detector on the wall.

Step 1. Put the Carbon Monoxide Detector at desired installation location, use the Walk Test function to confirm signal strength is satisfactory.

Step 2. Use the mounting bracket as template to mark the two holes on the wall at chosen location for installing screws.

Step 3. Screw the mounting bracket onto the wall according to marked location. Install wall plugs if necessary.

Step 4. Hook the Carbon Monoxide Detector onto the mounting bracket. Installation is now complete.

* _**Sensor Life and Maintenence**_
  * The Carbon Monoxide Detector uses its built-in electrochemical sensor for Carbon Monoxide detection. The sensor has approximately **10** years of operation life. Make sure to replace the device at end of its life span.
  * Clean the front cover of the device regularly to avoid dust or debris which may affect air sampling. Wipe the surface with a cloth dampened with clean water when cleaning, do not use cleaning agents, detergents or solvents.
  * Avoid using aerosols near the device.
  * Do not paint the device, the painting may block the detector the vent hole and affects its ability to sample air.

**WARNING**

* Prevent CO-8 from colliding or falling that could damage the device.
* This Apparatus is designed to protect individuals from the acute effects of carbon monoxide exposure. It will not fully safeguard individuals with specific medical conditions. If in doubt consult a medical practitioner.
* In case of an alarm, promptly hold your breath to prevent inhaling carbon monoxide and open the doors /windows to clear the air, then leave your premises for safety.
* Exposed to carbon monoxide could result in CO poisoning, causing headaches, dizziness, vomiting as effects. Inhaling large amount of CO could even result in severe conditions such as heart rate rises, unconsciousness and respiratory failures even death.
* You must **NOT** modify the apparatus under any circumstances.
* The apparatus should be installed for regular home environment; it should not be substituted /used for other purposes such as maintenance of fuel burning appliances, boilers, chimneys.
* The operating temperature is -10°C to 50°C, operation humidity up to 85% non-condensing.
