  * If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Carbon Monoxide Detector for a preset period of time, the Control Panel will determine the Carbon Monoxide Detector has failed supervision and is out-of-order.
* _**Carbon Monoxide Detection**_
  * The alarm will be activated after CO concentration is detected according to time length in following table:

| **CO Concentration level** | Time taken before **alarming** |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 30 ppm                     | N/A                            |
| 50 ppm                     | 60\~90 minutes                 |
| 100 ppm                    | 10\~40 minutes                 |
| 300 ppm                    | Under 3 minutes                |

* Once the alarm is activated, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will transmit alarm signal and activate its buzzer to raise alarm. The Red LED will begin to flash rapidly.
* After alarm activation, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will continue to sound alarm and resend alarm signal every 2 minutes until the CO concentration drops below 30 ppm. When the concentration drops below 30 ppm, the carbon Monoxide Detector will stop sounding alarm and transmit a restore signal.
* _**Alarm Silence**_
  * When the alarm is sounding, pressing the Test button will put the Carbon Monoxide Detector into Alarm Silence mode for 10 minutes and the alarm will be stopped temporarily.
  * After this 10-min period is over, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will check the Carbon Monoxide concentration again. If the Carbon Monoxide concentration is still over the set threshold value, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will sound the warning alarm again. If not, it will return to normal operation mode and transmit restore signal.
* _**Self-diagnostics**_

The Carbon Monoxide Detector will perform self-diagnostics every 12 hours. The user can also press and hold the test button for 10 seconds to perform self-diagnostics. If any fault is detected, the Carbon Monoxide Detector will transmit signal to the Control Panel, and the Amber LED will flash every 5 seconds. The following three conditions of Carbon Monoxide Sensor can be detected via self-diagnostics.

| **Condition** | **Description**                                                                                                              | **Report to Control Panel** |   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | - |
| Good Sensor   | The CO Sensor functions normally.                                                                                            | No                          |   |
| Short Sensor  | The CO Sensor fails to function normally because the positive and negative poles are connected together.                     | Yes                         |   |
| Open Sensor   | The CO Sensor fails to function normally because it has come off or either the positive pole or the negative pole is broken. | Yes                         |   |

* _**Learning**_

Step 1 Insert the 3 “**AA**” batteries into the battery compartment according to correct polarity shown on the battery holder.
