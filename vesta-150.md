* _**Installation Procedures**_

Step 1. Put the Control Panel into **Learning Mode**. Please refer to the Control Panel manual.

Step 2. Enable Remote keypad to enter Test mode first. Enter the Keypad PIN code (default: **0000**) followed by Ôºä key. The **Red** LED will turns on and sound a long beep.

Step 3. Press Ôºä key and then 7 key to transmit learn code to Control Panel. Refer to Control Panel manual to complete the learning process. If learning is successful, the Keypad will emit 3 beeps upon receiving acknowledgement signal from Control Panel.

If the Keypad does not sound 3 beeps, please restart learning procedure from Step 1.

Step 4. After the Remote keypad is learnt-in, put the Control Panel into **Walk Test** mode, hold the Remote keypad in the desired location, and send the learning code to the Control Panel to confirm this location is within the signal range of the Control Panel.

Step 5. When you are satisfied that the Remote keypad works in the chosen location, you can proceed with mounting the Remote keypad following the steps described below (see _**Mounting Remote keypad**)_.

* _**Tamper Protection**_
* The keypad is protected against any attempt to open the lid or to detach keypad from its mounting surface.
* Tamper protection is disabled when the keypad is in Test Mode.
* _**Tag Learning/Clearing Procedures**_

The Keypad is capable of storing information from NFC (Near Field Communication) tags and assigns a PIN Code to each NFC tag stored in memory. The NFC tag can then be used to control alarm system mode through the Keypad.

The Keypad can learn up to 100 NFC tags with up to 50 PIN Codes.

**\<NOTE>**

* The Keypad NFC tag sensor is powered on 10 seconds after inserting battery.

1. _**Tag Learning procedure**_

Step 1. Enable Remote keypad to enter Test mode first. Enter the Keypad PIN code (default: **0000**) followed by Ôºä key. The **Red** LED will turns on and sound a long beep

Step 2. Press Ôºä key and then **1** key to enter the Tag Learning mode.

Step 3. Enter Control Panel User PIN code followed by # key. The Keypad will sound a beep and the Orange LED will begin to flash for 5 seconds.

* If the entered PIN Code is new, the Keypad will sound a long beep.
* If the entered PIN Code already exists in Keypad, the Keypad will sound a short beep

Step 4. Within 5 seconds, apply a tag to the Keypad Tag sensor zone to pair it with the User PIN Code just entered:

* Each tag paired will reset tag learning time to 5 seconds. You can pair multiple tags with a single User Code by applying the tags one by one.
* The Keypad will exit tag learning mode after 5 seconds of inactivity.
* If the tag learnt in is new, the Keypad will emit 2 short beeps.
* If the tag learnt in already exists in Keypad (assigned to another PIN Code), the Keypad will emit 1 short beep.

Step 5. To learn in another Tag, please repeat step 3 to step 4. The keypad will exit tag learning mode automatically after idling for 5 seconds.

Step 6. Press ‚Äú#‚Äù key to return to Test Mode.

* Error Condition:
* If the Control Panel User Code entered exceeds 4 digits, the Orange LED will flash along with 4 short beeps to indicate error.
* If the Keypad has already stored 50 Control Panel PIN Codes, the Red LED will flash along with 4 short beeps to indicate error when you attempt to enter the 51st PIN Code.
* If the Keypad has already learnt in 100 NFC tags, the Orange LED will flash to indicate error when you attempt to learn in the 101st NFC tag.

1. _**Tag Clearing Procedure:**_

You can clear tag information.

Step 1. Enable Remote keypad to enter Test mode first. Enter the PIN code (default: 0000) followed by Ôºä key. The Red LED turns on along with a long beep sounding.

Step 2. Press Ôºä key and then 1 key to enter to the Tag Learning mode.

Step 3. If you wish to remove a Control Panel PIN Code stored in the Keypad and all tags assigned to this PIN Code, enter Control Panel User code and press Ôºä key, a long beep will sound.

If you wish to clear only a specific tag, press Ôºä key with a long beep and Orange LED will flash for 5 seconds. Apply tag to tag sensor zone within 5 seconds:

* If the tag applied exists in Keypad, the Keypad will sound 2 short beeps to indicate the tag data has been removed.
* If the tag applied does not exist in Keypad the Keypad will sound 4 short beeps to indicate error.
* Each tag applied will reset the tag removal timer to 5 seconds, you can remove multiple tags by applying the one by one.

Step 4. The Keypad will exit tag removal mode automatically after idling for 5 seconds.

Step 5. Press ‚Äú#‚Äù key to return to Test Mode.

* _**Mounting Remote Keypad**_

To mount the remote keypad:

1. Remove the front cover.
2. Using the 2 mounting holes of the back cover as a template, mark off the positions in the most appropriate place.
3. Insert the wall plugs if fixing into plaster or brick surface.
4. Screw the Remote keypad onto the wall plugs.
5. Replace the front cover.

* _**How to Set System Mode**_
