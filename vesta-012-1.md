* _**NFC Label Learning/Clearing/Installation Procedures**_

![](<.gitbook/assets/15 (5).jpeg>)

NFC stands for Near Field Communication, which is a wireless communication technology that establishes connection between two devices by putting them close together. You can store a User PIN Code in a NFC label and use the NFC label to access the alarm system without entering a User PIN Code on KPT-39N. The Keypad can learn up to 100 NFC labels with up to 50 PIN Codes.

_**A. NFC Learning Procedure:**_

Step 1. Enable remote keypad to enter Test mode first. Enter the Keypad PIN code (default: **0000**) followed by ＊ key. While entering the PIN code, the **Power LED** (Green) will turns on. The **Power LED** will then turn off and sound a long beep.

Step 2. Press ＊ key and then **1** key to enter NFC label Learning mode. The **Fault LED** (Orange) will turn on and sound a long beep.

Step 3. Enter a new PIN code followed by # key. The Keypad will emit a long beep, and the orange LED will begin to flash for 5 seconds to indicate it is ready to learn a NFC label.

Step 4. Within 5 seconds, put a NFC label close to the Keypad detection area to pair it with the User PIN Code just entered.

* Each label paired will reset NFC label learning time to 5 seconds. You can pair multiple labels with a single User Code by applying the labels one by one.
* The Keypad will exit NFC label learning mode after 5 seconds of inactivity.
* If the label learnt in is new, the Keypad will emit 2 short beeps.
* If the label learnt in already exists in Keypad (assigned to another PIN Code), the Keypad will emit 1 short beep.

Step 5. To learn in another label, please repeat step 3 to step 4. The keypad will exit NFC label learning mode automatically after idling for 5 seconds.

Step 6. Press ![](<.gitbook/assets/16 (4).jpeg>) key to exit NFC label learning mode.

* Error Condition:
  * If the Control Panel User Code entered exceeds maximum PIN code digits, the Orange LED will flash along with 4 short beeps to indicate error.
  * If the Keypad has already stored 50 Control Panel PIN Codes, it will emit 4 short beeps to indicate error when you attempt to enter the 51st PIN Code.
  * If the Keypad has already learnt in 100 NFC labels, it will emit 4 short beeps to indicate error when you attempt to learn in the 101st NFC label.

_**B. NFC Clearing Procedure:**_

You can clear NFC label information.

Step 1. Enable remote keypad to enter Test mode first. Enter the Keypad PIN code (default: **0000**) followed by ＊ key. While entering the PIN code, the **Power LED** (Green) will turn on. The **Power LED** will then turn off and sound a long beep.
