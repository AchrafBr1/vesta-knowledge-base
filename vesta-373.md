**Function Overview**

* **Alarm Memory**

If an alarm was triggered in your absence and the system was not disarmed before alarm length expiry, the Siren will sound a short alarm when the system is disarmed to warn the user that an alarm has been triggered when he is away. This suggests that the intruder could still be within the premises.

* **Alarm Length**

When an alarm is activated by the Control Panel, the Control Panel will notify the Siren to start alarming according to the panel’s alarm length setting. When the Panel’s alarm length expires, it will notify the Siren to stop the alarm.

If the Siren does not receive the signal from the Control Panel to stop the alarm, it will sound the alarm for a maximum of 15 minutes, and then stop the alarm.

For example:

*
  * If the Panel’s alarm length is set to more than 15 minutes, after an alarm is activated, instead of waiting the panel’s alarm length to expire, the Siren will stop alarming after 15 minutes.
  * If the panel is under disarmed mode and the Siren tamper switch is triggered, the Siren will not activate the alarm since the panel is under disarmed mode, and will activate the alarm for 15 minutes due to tamper triggering.
* **Siren Tamper**

The Siren is protected against any attempts to open the lid or to detach the Siren from its mounting surface.

If the Siren detects a tamper condition, it will activate the siren for the programmed alarm length. A tamper signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular signal transmissions for the Control Panel to display the status accordingly. If the tamper condition continues, the Siren will sound a series of five beeps either every time the system is armed or when the tamper is enabled, to indicate a fault.

The tamper feature can be disabled temporaily from the Control Panel using the Siren Tamper control function. The Siren will stop tamper detection temporarily for one hour. This function is mainly designed for replacing the batteries or changing the installation location. After one hour, the Control Panel will automatically turn the function back ON. The tamper detection can also be enabled again manually using the Siren Tamper control function.

* **Audio Status Indication**

While arming / disarming the system, the Siren uses different methods to distinguish various statuses for the user, as listed in the table below.
