## **Slim Door Contact**

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Slim Door Contact monitors the opening/closing of specified devices (e.g., doors or windows). The Door Contact is fixed to the monitored device frame with an actuating magnet fixed to the device. When the door or window opens, the magnet moves away from the Door Contact, activating an internal magnetic switch and causing the Door Contact to transmit an alarm signal to the Control Panel. The Door Contact also has the capability of communicating signal problems along with low battery situations.

## **Features**

### _**LED Indicator**_

In Normal operation mode, the LED indicator remains off except in the following situations:

* When the Door Contact is activated under Low battery condition.
* When the Door Contact is activated and transmitting the signal under the Test mode.

### _**Supervision**_

* The Door Contact will automatically transmit supervision signals to the Control Panel at random intervals of 30 to 50 minutes in Normal Operation Mode.
* If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Door Contact for a preset period time, the Control Panel will indicate that the Door Contact is experiencing an out-of-signal problem.

### _**Battery**_

* The Door Contact uses a Lithium Manganese Dioxide (Li/MnO2) battery pack as its power source.
* The Door Contact is also capable of detecting low battery condition. When the battery is low, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular signal transmission. The LED will light up when the Door Contact is activated under low battery status.

Note:

The pre-inserted battery in the Slim Door Contact cannot be replaced or switched out.

### _**Test Mode**_

* The Door Contact can be put into Test mode for 3 minutes by pressing the Learn/Test Button once.
* During Test mode, the LED indicator will light up upon triggering of the Door Contact.
* Each press on the Test Button will cause the Door Contact to transmit a test signal to the Control Panel for radio range test and reset the test mode to another 3 minutes.
* The Door Contact will automatically exit Test Mode after the 3-minute duration and return to Normal Operation mode.

## **Getting Started**

### _**Learning**_

**Step 1:** Pull out the battery insulator to power the Door Contact.

**Step 2:** Put the Control Panel into learning mode (refer to the Control Panel manual for details).

**Step 3:** Press the Learn/Test Button on Door Contact to send a learn code to the Control Panel.

**Step 4:** If the Control Panel successfully receives the code, the Control Panel will respond (e.g., emit beeps). Refer to your Control Panel manual to complete the learning process.

**Step 5:** After the Door Contact is learnt-in, put the Control Panel into “**Walk Test**” mode, hold the Door Contact at

the desired location, and press the Learn/Test button to confirm if this location is within the signal range of the Control Panel.

**Step 6:** If you are satisfied that the Door Contact works at the chosen location, you may proceed to installation.

## _**Installation**_

**Step 1:** <mark style="background-color:blue;">The mounting surface should be clean, dry, and smooth. Clean the mounting surface with a suitable degreaser if needed.</mark>

**Step 2:** <mark style="background-color:blue;">Remove the tape liner from the adhesive tape on the back of the Door Contact.</mark>

**Step 3:** Apply the Door Contact to the mounting surface (i.e., the door frame or window frame) <mark style="background-color:blue;">and press firmly for 30 seconds to ensure good adhesion.</mark>

**Step 4.** Remove the tape liner from the adhesive tape on the magnet

**Step 5.** Apply the magnet on a mobile object, i.e., the door or window, <mark style="background-color:blue;">and press firmly for 30 seconds to ensure good adhesion.</mark> The magnet must be aligned with the magnet detection area of the Door Contact (Please refer to Magnet Scope Positioning below).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Do not apply the 3M adhesive tape on a surface with peeling or cracked paint, or on a rough surface.</mark>

<mark style="background-color:blue;">The 3M adhesive tape cannot be reused.</mark>

* _**Magnet Scope Positioning**_
  * The area near the Learn/Test Button of the Door Contact is the main **magnet detection area.**
  * The **magnet detection area** is polished for easy identification.
  * The magnet should be no more than **15mm** from the Door Contact when the door/window is closed.
  * The magnet should be positioned corresponding to the magnet detection area as the pictures below.
  * When installing within a door / window slot (similar as the image above), the gap between the window and window frame should be greater than **5mm**, or the window cannot be properly closed.
