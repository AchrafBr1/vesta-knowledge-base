### INTRODUCTION

It creates a curtain barrier of small dimensions (about&#x20;7.5°) and has an adjustable range up to 6 m.\
It is made with materials resistant to agents (IP54). In addition,&#x20;the electronics are subjected to a tropicalization process&#x20;to ensure correct operation in all conditions of humidity and temperature, which makes it a stable sensor and&#x20;immune to false alarms.

### FEATURES

* Curtain detector of double technology
* 8 meter coverage, 30 °
*  24 GHz microwave frequency
* It incorporates via radio Vesta Climax F1
* Tamper
* Powered by 3.6V lithium battery

### PART IDENTIFICATION

A) GND/+V: Power supply 3-10V. Respect the polarities. The circuit is protected from inversions

B) AMK: Disorientation alarm terminal block

C) ALC: Alarm output, in case of alarm generated by infrared and microwave ALNC opens, ALNO closes. Max current 55mA

D) TPC: Tamper output, in case of tampering the TPNC contact opens, TPNO closes.

E) DIP SWITCHES

F)  TAMPER

G) ACCELEROMETER

H) TRIMMER MW: MW regulation, clockwise increases the flow rate

I) TRIMMER IR: IR adjustment, clockwise increases the range

L) MICROWAVE SENSOR

M) RED LED: In test mode it flashes quickly as soon as it detects IR and becomes fixed for 2 seconds if it also detects microwave

### INSTALLATION

Open the cover and set Dip4 to ON (the LED&#x20;will flash 3 times) then close the cover. From this moment on, the LED and sensor&#x20;will no longer be inhibited (they will&#x20;always be active). At each infrared detection, the LED&#x20;flashes quickly and becomes fixed for 2 seconds if the&#x20;microwave also detects movement. Perform the crossing tests and, by acting on the MW and IR trimmers, adjust the&#x20;sensitivity of the respective sensors (ATTENTION: the microwave is&#x20;activated only after the PIR has gone into alarm). Once the&#x20;detection tests are complete, wait 10 seconds then set Dip4 to&#x20;OFF and close the cover (DO NOT MOVE THE SENSOR AGAIN FROM NOW ON); after 10 flashes of the LED, the sensor&#x20;will remain inhibited for 4 minutes, will memorize its position&#x20;and will exit the TEST mode. From this moment on,&#x20;any movement of the sensor will generate a TAMPER alarm.

<table><thead><tr><th width="87"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>DIP 1</td><td>ON: low battery warning, 2 flashes every 8 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>DIP 2</td><td>Leave in OFF</td></tr><tr><td>DIP 3</td><td>ON: stand-by alarm signal, the red LED lights up at each detection</td></tr><tr><td>DIP 4</td><td>ON: test mode (no inhibition, LED active) only for programming and adjusting the sensor sensitivity</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

It is mandatory to set Dip 4 to OFF after having carried out the&#x20;programming and adjustments of the sensors, furthermore it is recommended to&#x20;set all the Dips to OFF to increase the battery life.
