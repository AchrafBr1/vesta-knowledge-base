1. Press the Learn/Test button once to transmit a learn code.

If the Control Panel receives the signal, the Smoke Detector will emit a 2-tone beep. Refer to Control Panel manual to complete learning process.

**Step 5.** When the Smoke Detector completes warm-up, it will emit a beep to indicate it has entered calibration mode. The calibration mode lasts for 1\~9 minutes. The Red LED will continue to flash every two seconds during calibration. Learning the Smoke Detector is prohibited during this period.

**Step 6.** When calibration is completed, the Smoke Detector will emit 2 short beeps and turn off LED to return to normal mode. If the Smoke Detector is not learnt into panel previously, press the Learn/Test button now to complete learning.

* Testing the Smoke Detector

By pressing the Test Button on the Smoke Detector, you can test if the Smoke Detector is functioning normally.

* If the Smoke Detector functions normally, the Red LED will be on for 2 seconds followed by a 2-tone beep.
* If the buzzer sounds 2-tone beeps 3 times, the “**Optical Chamber**” on the Smoke Detector is either dirty or out-of-order.
* _**Test Mode for IR Function**_
* The Smoke Detector can be put into Test mode by pressing the Test Button. Every time the Test Button is pressed, the Smoke Detector will transmit a test signal to the Control Panel for radio range test and enter the test mode for 3 mins. It will exit Test Mode automatically after 3 minutes and return to normal mode. In Test mode, the sleep timer is disabled, and the LED indicator will flash every time a movement is detected.
* Supervision
* The Smoke Detector will transmit a supervision signal to report its condition regularly according to user setting. The factory default interval is 30\~50 minutes. The user can also press the Test Button once to transmit a supervision signal manually.
* _**Temperature Detection**_** (SD-29-H/SD-29-HM/SD-29-HME only)**
* The Temperature Sensor measures temperature every 10 seconds, and transmits temperature reading to the Control Panel every 30\~33 minutes.
* Users can also press the Test Button once to transmit current temperature reading manually.
* Alarm Activation

The Smoke Detector will activate fire alarm when either of its smoke detection or high heat detection function is triggered. When an alarm is activated, the Smoke Detector will transmit alarm signal and raise alarm with its built-in buzzer.

**Smoke Detection:**

* The Smoke Detector checks smoke concentration every 8 seconds
* The alarm is activated whenever the smoke concentration exceeds the detection threshold, and will continue until the smoke concentration drops below alarm threshold.
* The Red LED will flash quickly during alarm.

**Heat Detection:**

* The Smoke Detector checks temperature every 10 seconds. The alarm will be activated in the following conditions:

\- When the temperature rises by 8.25°C per minute (Rate of Rise).

\- When the temperature exceeds 57.25°C (High Heat).

* The Red LED will flash every second during alarm. The Smoke Detector will only stop alarming if the temperature drops below alarm threshold:
* If the alarm was triggered by Rate of Rise condition (8.25°C per minute or more), the temperature must drop to 4°C below highest temperature detected for the detector to stop alarming.
* If the alarm was triggered by High Heat condition (57.25°C), the temperature must drop below 49°C for the Smoke Detector to stop alarming.
* The Smoke Detector will transmit a restore signal if no smoke or high heat is detected for 160 seconds.
* If the alarm condition persists, the Smoke Detector will resend alarm signal every 2 minutes.

**IR Detection: (SD-29-HM/SD-29-HME only)**

* The Smoke Detector will transmit signal to the Control Panel if any movement is picked up within the IR detection coverage. The buzzer will not sound and the LED will not flash. Please refer to your Control Panel for details.
* Emergency Light (SD-29-HME only)
* The Smoke Detector has a built-in emergency light that can provide visual alerts in case of emergency. When the Smoke Detector is activated, the emergency light will begin to flash slowly to indicate the system is alarming.
* _Interconnection_ _(SD-29-HME-SC only)_
* The Smoke Detector is interconnected with other Smoke Detector in the alarm system. When a Smoke Detector activates alarm, the Control Panel will notify other Smoke Detectors to also raise alarm even if they have not detected smoke yet. The alarm length will be in accordance with the Control Panel’s setting.
* You cannot press the function button to silence alarm activated by other Smoke Detectors.
* Alarm will be restored only after 3 minutes timeout or until the other Smoke Detector which triggers alarm transmits a restore signal.
* Alarm Silence
* When the Smoke Detector is alarming, pressing the Test button will put the Smoke Detector into Alarm Silence mode to silence the alarm for 9 minutes. The buzzer will only stop sounding after the alarm has been activated for at least 1-minute. If the button is pressed before alarm time reaches 1 minute, the Smoke Detector will wait until alarm time has reach 1 minute before silencing the alarm.
* During the 9-minute Alarm Silence period, the Red LED will flash once per second. The Smoke Detector will continue to monitor smoke concentration during the alarm silence period:
* After the 9-minute Alarm Silence period has expired, if the smoke concentration has dropped below alarm threshold, the Smoke Detector will emit a 2-tone beep and return to normal operation without sounding alarm.
* If smoke concentration still exceeds alarm threshold, the Smoke Detector will start alarming again.
* If smoke concentration continues to rise during Alarm Silence period and exceeds a second alarm threshold, the Smoke Detector will start alarming again. An alarm activated by exceeding the second alarm threshold could not be silenced by pressing the test button.
* Recalibration

As the operation condition of the Smoke Detector may vary after being installed for some time, you may wish to recalibrate the Smoke Detector to take a new smoke detection threshold value and ensure optimal performance of the Smoke Detector. To do this:

* Press and hold the Test Button for 10 seconds and release when the Smoke Detector emits 2 beeps. The device will sound another beep after 5 seconds and begin calibration. The Red LED will flash every 2 seconds to indicate.
* Calibration process lasts 1\~9 minute.
* When calibration is finished, the Smoke Detector will sound a two-tone beep. The Red LED will stop flashing to indicate it has returned to normal mode.
* If calibration fails, the Smoke Detector will beep continuously, and the Orange LED will flash every second. Please remove the battery, press the Test Button twice to fully discharge, and then reinsert the batteries to restart Smoke Detector.
