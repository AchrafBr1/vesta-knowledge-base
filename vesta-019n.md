## **User Manual**

The Door Contact monitors the opening/closing of specified devices (e.g. door or window). The Door Contact is fixed to the monitored device frame with an actuating magnet fixed to the device. When the door or window opens, the magnet moves away from the Door Contact, activating an internal magnetic switch and causing the Door Contact to transmit an alarm signal to the Central Panel. The device also has the capabilities of communicating signal problems along with low battery situations.

The Door Contact design consists of a cover and base. The cover contains all electronics, and the base provides a means for fixing the device. An enclosed PCB tamper switch provides tamper protection against unauthorized device opening and/or removal.

DC-23 Series Door Contact includes the following models:

DC-23: Door Contact cover is secured by a bottom fixing screw.

DC-23-R3: Door Contact cover is secured by two latches at the top and bottom

* The extension terminal and internal magnetic switch can function together to trigger the Door Contact when either of them is activated, you can also choose to disable the internal magnetic switch through the JP3 Jumper setting. If both the extension terminal and the internal magnetic switch are in use and any of them is triggered (opened). The Door Contact will only send a Door Contact close (restore) signal when both of them are closed.

#### _**Battery**_ <a href="#battery" id="battery"></a>

* The Door Contact is powered by one CR123 3V Lithium battery. Please note: **ALWAYS** replace the battery with the correct size and voltage.
* The Door Contact can detect low battery condition. When the battery voltage is low, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel to notify the condition. The LED will light up when the Door Contact is activated under low battery status. When the battery is exhausted, the Door Contact will stop all functions, the LED will flash every 4 seconds.
* When changing the battery, after removing the old batteries, press the Tamper Switch twice to fully discharge before inserting the new battery.

#### _**Tamper Protection**_ <a href="#tamper-protection" id="tamper-protection"></a>

* The Door Contact is protected by a tamper switch, which is compressed against the mounting surface when the Door Contact is mounted. Whenever the Door Contact cover is opened or removed from the mounted surface, the tamper switch will be activated and the Door Contact will send a tamper open signal to remind the user of the condition.

#### _**Supervisory Signal**_ <a href="#supervisory-signal" id="supervisory-signal"></a>

* Supervision function for the 868WF model is controlled by the JP2 jumper setting. For the non-868WF model, supervision function is always enabled.
* When enabled, the Door Contact will automatically transmit Supervisory Signals periodically to the Control Panel at random intervals of 30-50 minutes.
* If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Door Contact for a preset period time, the Control Panel will indicate the particular Door Contact is experiencing an out-of-signal problem.

#### _**Test Mode**_ <a href="#test-mode" id="test-mode"></a>

* Under Normal Mode, press the Test Button to transmit a test signal and learning code to the Control Panel. The Door Contact will also enter the Test Mode for 3 minutes.
* Under Test Mode, the LED will light up whenever the Door Contact is activated.
* Each additional Test Button press will reset the Test Mode time to 3 minutes.

#### _**Getting Started**_ <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

* Open the cover of the Door Contact and insert the battery.
* Put the Control Panel into Learning Mode (please refer to the panel operation manual).
