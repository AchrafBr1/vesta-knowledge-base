## _**LED Indicator:**_

* **Green Active LED:**
  * Green Active LED on: the system is in **Normal Operation Mode**.
  * Green Active LED flash: the system is in **Test Mode**.
  * When the Keypad is idle, all LEDs are off. After any key press, the Green Active LED turns on for 5 seconds, indicating that the Keypad is active.
  * The Green Active LED will turn off after successful completion of a valid keystroke sequence or when the pause in between keystrokes is longer than 5 seconds.
  * When the Green Active LED turns off before a valid keystroke sequence is completed (5 seconds), the previously entered keys are ignored.
* **Red TX LED:**
  * The Red TX LED flashes: the signal is transmitted.
* **Orange Fault LED:**
  * Orange Fault LED flash: The Battery is low during operation.
  * Orange Fault LED on: Tamper is triggered during operation.
  * When the Keypad Tamper is triggered and the battery is low, the Orange Fault LED turns on during operation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

A short beep will be sounded with each key press, which confirms a valid pressing.

4 continuous beeps will sound, indicating to the user that he has entered an invalid keystroke, and the user is asked to repeat the process again.
{% endhint %}

## _**Power:**_

* The Keypad uses a CR2450 3V 540mAH lithium battery as its power source.
* The Keypad can also detect the battery status. Low battery detection operates where the Keypad has enough reserve energy to typically operate for 4 month before complete exhaustion.
* When the Keypad has low battery, the Orange Fault LED will flash during operation, and a low battery signal will be transmitted along with regular signal transmissions.
* Before shipment, the battery is pre-installed by the factory.

## _**Tamper Protection:**_

* The keypad is protected against any attempt to open the lid or to detach the Keypad from its mounting surface.
* Tamper protection is disabled when in Test Mode.
* When the Keypad Tamper is triggered, it will send a KP Tamper Fault signal to the Control Panel, and the Orange Fault LED will turn on. In addition, while using the keypad, the orange Fault LED will stay on to indicate the KP Tamper Fault.

## _**Power Saving Feature:**_

* When the Keypad is not being used, no power is consumed. Whenever a key is pressed, the Keypad will activate and ‚Äú**wake-up**‚Äù for 5 seconds when any key is pressed.
* After 5 seconds of key inactivity, the power turns off again and returns to Stand-by mode.
* Upon completion of a command input, the power turns off and returns to Stand-by mode.

## _**Test mode:**_

* The keypad can be put into Test mode by entering the PIN code (default: **0000**) followed by Ôºä. The Green Active LED will flash, and the Keypad will sound a long beep.
* To exit Test mode, press (button disarm) **twice**. The keypad will sound a long beep, and the Green Active LED will turn on, then the Keypad returns to Normal Operation mode.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

Test Mode is helpful to bypass the Keypad Tamper alarm when installing, replacing low batteries or removing to a different mount site.

When the Keypad is in Test mode, it operates as a **wake-up** condition and thus will NOT disconnect after 5 seconds.

In Test Mode, if no key is pressed within 30 minutes, the keypad will automatically exit Test Mode to Normal Operation mode.
