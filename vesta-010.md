* _**LED Indicator:**_
* **Green Active LED:**
  *
    * Green Active LED on: the system is in **Normal Operation Mode**.
    * Green Active LED flash: the system is in **Test Mode**.
    * When the Keypad is idle, all LEDs are off. After any key press, the Green Active LED turns on for 5 seconds indicating that Keypad is active.
    * The Green Active LED will turn off after successful completion of a valid keystroke sequence or when the pause in between keystrokes is longer than 5 seconds.
    * When the Green Active LED turns off before a valid keystroke sequence is completed (5 seconds), the previous entered keys are ignored.
* **Red TX LED:**
  *
    * The Red TX LED flash: the signal is transmitted.
* **Orange Fault LED:**
  *
    * Orange Fault LED flash: Battery is low during operation.
    * Orange Fault LED on: Tamper is trigger during operation.
    * When Keypad Tamper is trigger and battery is low, the Orange Fault LED turns on during operation.

**\<NOTE>**

* A short beep will be sounded with each key press, which confirms valid pressing.
* 4 continuous beeps will sound indicating the user that he has entered invalid keystroke, and the user is asked to repeat the process again.
* _**Power:**_
* The Keypad uses a CR2450 3V 540mAH lithium battery as its power source.
* The Keypad can also detect the battery status. Low battery detection operates where the Keypad has enough reserve energy to typically operate for 4 month before complete exhaustion.
* When the Keypad has low battery, the Orange Fault LED will flash during operation and a low battery signal will be transmitted along with regular signal transmissions.
* Before shipment, the battery is pre-installed by the factory.
* _**Tamper Protection:**_
* Keypad is protected against any attempt to open the lid or to detach Keypad from its mounting surface.
* Tamper protection is disabled when in Test Mode.
* When Keypad Tamper is trigger, it will send KP Tamper Fault signal to Control Panel and the Orange Fault LED will turn on. In addition, during using the keypad, Orange Fault LED will stay on to indicate the KP Tamper Fault.
* _**Power Saving Feature:**_
* When the Keypad is not being used, no power is consumed. Whenever a key is pressed, the Keypad will activate and ‚Äú**wake-up**‚Äù for 5 seconds when any key is pressed.
* After 5 seconds of key inactivity, the power turns off again and returns to Stand-by mode.
* Upon completion of a command input, the power turns off and returns to Stand-by mode.
* _**Test mode:**_
* Keypad can be put into Test mode by entering the PIN code (default: **0000**) followed by Ôºä. The Green Active LED will flash and Keypad sounds a long beep.
* To exit Test mode, press ![](<.gitbook/assets/5 (5) (1).png>) **twice**, Keypad will sound a long beep and the Green Active LED will turn on, then Keypad returns to Normal Operation mode.

**\<NOTE>**

* Test Mode is helpful to bypass Keypad Tamper alarm when installing, replacing low batteries or removing to different mount site.
* When Keypad is in Test mode, it operates as **wake-up** condition thus will NOT disconnect after 5 seconds.
* In Test Mode, if no key is pressed within 30 minutes, the Keypadl will automatically exit Test Mode to Normal Operation mode.
