**VST-894(M)**

HD Outdoor Motion Sensor Camera

VST-894 is a new-generation Outdoor Motion Sensor Camera featuring two independent PIR sensors, installation height ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 meters and special analysis logic to provide exceptional detection precision.

Utilizing a unique dual-lens design, an alarm is only triggered when both the upper and lower PIR detection zones are crossed, dismissing false alarms. Moreover, VST-894 employs cutting-edge digital signal recognition logic, improving noise immunity through pattern analysis and environmental data evaluation, therefore e ectively di erentiating between false alarms and actual intrusions.

Additionally, VST-894 incorporates SF1 technology, which enables it to excel with 2 to 3 times faster VGA/QVGA alarm image transmission speed. With increased processing speed, the camera can send detailed HD images (up to 1280 x 720 pixels) for precise veri cation, thereby o ering clear visual veri cation to achieve enhanced security bene ts.
