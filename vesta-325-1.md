Manual button press&#x20;

Fall Detection&#x20;

In addition, the APP will make an emergency call to the emergency contact if the emergency contact is programmed on the Reporting page.

### **Alarm Event with Location** **Emergency Call**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

The smartphone’s Bluetooth function and GPS location function need to be turned ON, the SmartHomeSec app shall be kept alive in the background, so that the BL-3-FS device can communicate with the SmartHomeSec app, and the app can send alert with the location coordinates and report when the BL-3-FS active button is pressed.
{% endhint %}

### **Step Counter**

The BL-3-FS offers a step counter function. The smartphone app can count steps and alert users if they haven't met their step goal within a set time.

### _**One-Click Lanyard / Wristband Swtich**_

The Transmitter can be worn as a Pendant with lanyard or a Wrist Watch with wrist band. Please refer to instructions below to switch between wearing a Pendant or as a wrist watch.

**Step 1.** Push the **FRONT** of the transmitter to take it off from the lanyard frame.

**Step 2.** Remove the transmitter.

**Step 3.** Push the transmitter into the wristband frame from the **BACK** side until you hear a click sound. All done!

### _**Usage Recommendation for Fall Detection**_

To ensure reliable fall detection, wear the transmitter as a necklace and let it hang in front of the chest, so that Fall Sensor can be effectively triggered. Please do not place it in your bag or inside your pocket, which may lead to difficulty in alarm triggering or fall detection. Please note that Fall detection is not supported when wearing transmitter as a watch.

* Best way to wear the transmitter as a fall sensor **(O)**
  1. Let it hang in front of the chest and adjust lanyard length so that the sensor hangs at the bottom of the breastbone.

2. Expose the pendant outside and in front of any clothes or heavy/feather jacket.

* Wrong way to wear the transmitter **(X)**
  1. Necklace being too short (around clavicle) or too long (below breastbone) is likely to cause false trigger or no response.
  2. Transmitter being placed inside a pocket or a bag will lead to detection failures.
* Carefully place the transmitter on a desk when you are not using it in order to avoid triggering a false alarm.
* Due to the fall detection mechanism’s inherent nature, it cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. False alarms or detection failures may occur during daily use and cannot be completely avoided.

False alarms or detection failures are more likely to happen in the following scenarios:

1. When transmitter is placed in a pocket.
2. When transmitter does not make contact with the ground, such as landing on the users’ chest, shoulders, or a thick coat/jacket).
3. When users fall onto a lawn or into water-filled tub.
4. Please utilize the Active Button to activate an alarm manually to ensure safety when needed.

### _**Wearing the Emergency Pendant as Wrist Watch**_

**Step 1.** Slide the top part of the wristband through the hole at the end of the bottom part of the wristband.

**Step 2.** Push the protruding part on the inner wristband into right hole for your wrist size.
