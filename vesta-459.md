## **Integration Module for Yale Doorman Locks (DDL-C3)**

The DDL-C3 is an RF module that works with Yale Doorman L3 Lock and Yale Doorman V2N Lock. It is inserted into the Yale door lock to enable the integration of the lock with Climax F1 Gateway Panel (HSGW-MAX8).

The integration allows user to remotely monitor the door & door lock's statuses, set user codes/tags, and remotely lock/unlock the door from smartphone app or portal.

Moreover, it offers the convenience of arming and disarming the alarm system by simply locking or unlocking the door.
