**Function Overview**

* **Alarm Memory**

1

If an alarm was triggered in your absence and the system was not disarmed before alarm length expiry, the Bellbox will sound a short alarm when the system is disarmed to warn the user that an alarm has been triggered when he is away. This suggests that the intruder could still be within the premises.

![](<.gitbook/assets/7 (46).png>)

* **Alarm Length**

The Bellbox’s alarm length is 15 minutes.

When the Panel is under disarm mode and the Bellbox tamper switch is triggered, the Bellbox will activate alarm according to its own alarm length (15 minutes) since the panel is under disarm mode and will not activate alarm from tamper trigger.

When an alarm is activated by Control Panel, the Control Panel will notify the Bellbox to start alarming according to the panel’s own alarm length setting. When the Panel’s alarm length expires, it will notify the Bellbox to stop alarm.

If the Panel alarm length is set longer than Bellbox alarm length (15 minutes), after an alarm is activated, instead of waiting panel alarm length to expire, the Bellbox will stop alarming upon expiry of its own alarm length (15 minutes)

* **Siren Tamper**

The Bellbox is protected against any attempt to open the lid or to detach the bellbox from its mounting surface.

If the Bellbox detects a tamper condition, it will activate the siren & strobe light for the programmed alarm period. A tamper signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular signal transmissions for the Control Panel to display the status accordingly. If the tamper condition persists, the Bellbox will sound a series of five beeps either every time the system is armed or when the tamper is enabled, to indicate a fault.

Tamper feature can be disabled temporaily from the Control Panel using Siren Tamper control function. The Bellbox will stop tamper detection temporarity for one hour. This function is mainly designed for replacing battery or changing Bellbox installation location. After one hour, the Control Panel will automatically turn the function back ON after the duration. The tamper detection can also be enabled again manually using the Siren Tamper function.

* **Audio & Visual Status Indication**

While arming / disarming the system, the BX-23 uses different methods to distinguish various statuses for the user, as listed in the table.
