## The Power Supply <a href="#toc51257984" id="toc51257984"></a>

The VDP uses 12\~24V DC or 16\~24V AC power as its power source. Turn off mains power first. Loosen the two screws of the 12\~24V DC or 16\~24V AC Power Input, and save the screws for later use. Connect wires to the inputs on the rear side of the back cover**\***; install the VDP to power on the device.

**\*Note:** It is recommended to use wire with a diameter less than 15mm to connect to the power input. The torque on the screw should be less than 24.5 nm (2.5 kg-m).

## LED Indicator <a href="#toc51257985" id="toc51257985"></a>

The Video Door Phone has built-in Blue and Red LEDs to indicate device status.

**Step 4.** Flip the VDP up-side-down and locate the 4 screws near the bottom of the VDP.

**Step 5.** Loosen the 2 screws of the 12\~24V DC or 16\~24V AC Power Input, and save the screws

for later use.

**Step 6.** Connect wires to the inputs on the rear side of the back cover, as shown in

Figure 1. It is recommended to use wire with a diameter less than 15mm to

connect to the power input. Please note the torque on the screw should be less

than 24.5 nm (2.5 kg-m)

**Step 7.** Locate the 2 mounting holes on the VDP, as shown in Figure 2, and screw the

VDP into the wall.

&#x20;                                                                 Figure 1                       Figure 2

## Setup <a href="#toc51257988" id="toc51257988"></a>

The Video Door Phone can be incorporated into existing Climax security system as an accessory device. To use the VDP, a Climax IP based security system alarm panel is required.

In order to incorporate the Video Door Phone into existing Climax security system, the Control Panel of the security system must be registered into Climax Home Portal Server first with a functional user account.

A smartphone with **Vesta Home 5 TW / Vesta Home 5 US** or **Vesta Home 5 EU** app installed is required to perform setup. Search for the app in Google Play or Apple App Store, type **Vesta Home 5 TW/US/EU** on the search bar according to your server, then download the application. Refer to Climax Home Portal Server user guide for detail.

3. Power up the Video Doorbell by applying AC power. The device will first warm up for about 30 seconds, and its Blue LED will begin to flash.

Flashing LED indicates the Video Doorbell does not have a working Wi-Fi setting yet. It will enter Wi-Fi setup mode (AP mode) automatically upon power-up.

4. Select the route to set up your Wi-Fi network and follow on-screen instructions. Please note if the VDP has already been set up to another Wi-Fi network, be sure to reset the device first before adding it into your existing alarm system.

4.1. Manual: Use your VDP as an AP. Connect to your Wi-Fi. Make sure your smartphone’s Wi-Fi is enabled. Follow on-screen instructions and wait for your VDP to connect to your Wi-Fi network. After successfully joining to your Wi-Fi network, the app proceeds to learn the VDP into the Control Panel. When learning is completed, re-login to the app and start using your VDP.
