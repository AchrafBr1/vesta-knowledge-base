Connect wires to the inputs on the rear side of the back cove&#x72;**\***; install the VDP to power on the device.

**\*Note:** It is recommended to use wire with a diameter less than 15mm to connect to the power input. The torque on the screw should be less than 24.5 nm (2.5 kg-m).

## LED Indicator <a href="#toc51257985" id="toc51257985"></a>
