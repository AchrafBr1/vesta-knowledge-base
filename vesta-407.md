## Features

### LED Indicator

In Normal operation mode, the LED indicator remains off except in the following situations:

* When Door Contact’s Tamper switch is triggered.
* When the Door Contact is activated with either Tamper or Low battery condition.
* When the Door Contact is activated and transmitting the signal under the Test mode.

### Supervision

* The Door Contact will automatically transmit Supervisory signals periodically to the Control Panel at random intervals of 15 to 18 minutes in Normal Operation Mode.
* If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Door Contact for a preset period of time, the Control Panel will indicate that particular Door Contact is experiencing an out-of-signal problem.

### Tamper Switch

The tamper switch is designed to protect against unauthorized cover opening. When the tamper is triggered, Door Contact will emit a signal to the Control Panel for reporting, the LED will also light up.

### Battery

The MDC-3-ADC2 uses one **3V CR2450 Lithium battery** as its power source. The Door Contact is also capable of detecting low battery. When the battery is low, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular transmission. The LED will light up when the Door Contact is activated under low battery status.

* **Changing the Battery**

You need to open the front and back covers to insert/remove the battery

Step 1  Use a flat-headed screwdriver to fit into the slit between the covers as **FIG. 1**.

Step 2  Push the flat-headed screwdriver upwards as **FIG. 2** to separate the covers.

Step 3   Turn to the other side and repeat Steps 1 and 2.

### _**Test Mode**_

* The Door Contact can be put into Test mode for 3 minutes by pressing the Test Button once.
* Under Test Mode, the LED will light up whenever the Door Contact is activated.
* Each additional Test Button press will reset Test Mode time to 3 minutes.

### Getting Started

Step 1  Remove the battery insulator of the Door Contact.

Step 2 Put the Control Panel into learning mode, refer to Control Panel manual for detail.

Step 3 Press the Learn/Test Button on Door Contact to send signals to the Control Panel.

Step 4 If the Panel successfully receives the signals, the Control Panel should respond (e.g., emitting beeps). Refer&#x20;to your Control Panel manual to complete the learning process.

Step 5 After the Door Contact is learnt-in, put the Control Panel into “**Walk Test**” mode, hold the Door Contact at the desired location, and press the Test button to confirm if this location is within signal range of the Panel.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with the Door Contact at the chosen location, proceed to **installation**.

## Installation

### Mounting Methods

* Mount the Door Contact on the fixed frame of a door/window using the **Velcro tape**, **adhesive tape**, or **Screw.**
* Mount the magnet on the mobile object (door/window) using **Screw Mounting** or **Adhesive Mounting**.
* Align the rib marks on the magnet and the Door Contact. Where required, use the magnet spacer to better align the rib marks.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The magnet should be no more than **6 mm** from the Door Contact when the door is closed.
