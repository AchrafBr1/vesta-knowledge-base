## **Introduction**

The ELSR-35 is battery-operated emergency light and siren that emits audible alerts and lights up when a fire occurs. The device could be installed on the top of the emergency exit to guide you the way out of dangers with LED lights. The built-in temperature sensor enables the ELSR-35 to monitor the temperatures of the surroundings.

## **Features**

### _**Battery and Low Battery Detection**_

The Emergency Light and Siren is powered by two 1.5V D-Cell Alkaline batteries. It features low battery detection and will transmit low battery signal when low battery voltage is detected.

When changing batteries, after removing the old batteries, press the learn button a couple times to fully discharge before inserting new batteries.

### _**Supervision**_

The Emergency Light and Siren will transmit a supervisory signal every 30-50 minutes in normal operation mode. If this signal is not received, the Control Panel will indicate that the particular Emergency Light and Siren is experiencing an out-of-order problem.

### _**Temperature Detection**_

The ELSR-35 has built-in temperature sensor that monitors the temperature of your surrounding environment. The temperature is detected and transmitted to the Control Panel every 30-50 minutes along with supervision signal.

### _**Alarm Length**_

When a fire, smoke, or CO alarm is activated, the Control Panel will notify the ELSR-35 to start alarming. The white LEDs will flash once every 1.5 seconds, and the built-in siren will emits audible alerts for a maximum of 15 minutes.

To silence and stop the ELSR-35 alarm, you can disarm or send siren off signal from the Control Panel.

### _**Tamper Protection**_

The Emergency Light and Siren is protected by tamper switch against any attempt to o detach the device from its mounting surface.

If the ELSR-35 detects a tamper condition, a tamper signal will be sent to the Control Panel to remind the user of the condition. When tamper condition is restored, a tamper restore signal will be sent to the Control Panel.

## **Getting Started**

### **Learning**

Step 1: Release the bottom screws of the ELSR-35 using a Philips screwdriver and remove the top cover.

Step 2: Put the Control Panel into learning mode (refer to Control Panelâ€™s user manual for details).

Step 3: Slide the power switch to ON position to power on the ELSR-35. All LEDs will flash once.

Step 4: Press the Learn button once. The ELSR-35 will emit a short beep and LED 1 & 3 will turn on briefly. The ELSR-35 is now in learning mode and will transmit a learning code to the Control Panel.

Step 5: If the Control Panel did not receive a learning code, press the learn button again.

Step 6: If the Control Panel receives the learning code, it will list the device information as siren and temperature sensor. Follow Control Panel manual instructions to complete the learning procedure. An acknowledgement will be sent to the ELSR-35. When the acknowledgment is received, the Emergency Light and Siren will sound two short beeps and flash LED 2 once to indicate that learning process is successful. The ELSR-35 will then leave learning mode.

## **Installation**

### _**Installation Guideline**_

* The ELSR-35 is designed with a waterproof case, usually installed on the top of the emergency exit.
* The ELSR-35 is designed to be mounted on a flat surface with fixing screws and plugs provided.
* The base has 2 mounting holes for you to screw the ELSR-35 onto the wall.

### _**Mounting the ELSR-35**_

1. Find the location where the ELSR-35 is to be mounted.
2. Remove the Top cover by releasing the bottom screws using a Philips screwdriver and pulling the outer case out carefully.
3. Hold the ELSR-35 at the position where it will be mounted.
4. Identify the 2 mounting holes, mount and fix the ELSR-35 on the wall using the large screws and wall plugs provided. Secure the screws using a Philips screwdriver. Make sure the Tamper Switch is fully depressed against the wall.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The tamper switch is secured with a button at the back of the base. When the device is pulled off from the wall, button will be released, the alarm will be activated. Ensure the button is fully depressed when the device is mounted. If there is a gap, pack with a suitable spacing material.

## **Factory Reset**

The Emergency Light and Siren can be reset and cleared of memory contents. Whenever the ELSR-35 is removed from the Control Panel, it should be put to factory reset to clear its Control Panel memory, otherwise the Emergency Light and Siren will still raise alarm if it receives fire/Smoke/CO alarm signal from panel.

Step 1. Remove the ELSR-35 from Control Panel device list (please refer to the Control Panel instruction manual).

Step 2: Release the bottom screws of the Top cover using a Philips screwdriver, remove the top cover.

Step 3: Slide the power switch to the OFF position.

Step 4: Press and hold the Learn Button and slide the battery switch to ON position. Continue to hold the Learn Button for 7 seconds. Release the Learn Button when you hear 2 short beeps and a long beep. The previous parameters in the Emergency Light and Siren will be cleared and it will return to normal mode.
