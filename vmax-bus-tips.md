# ðŸ’¡ VMAX BUS TIPS

**V-MAX BUS SYSTEM in VESTA panels tips:**

## **GENERAL RULES:**

* From one device or bus start to the next, no more than 300 metres may be exceeded.
* Take into account the current required for the system (use calculator or consumption table of the devices).
* Take into account the voltage drop (calculator) If there is a voltage drop, a power supply or isolator-amplifier can be used
* The limit of the BUS system at distance level will depend on the consumption and voltage at each point, if a sufficient current and voltage is guaranteed at each device, the system will operate correctly.

## **CASE 3: TREE LINES**

### **CASE 3A. WITH ISOLATOR (Recomended for this CASE)**

### **CASE 3B. WITH NO ISOLATOR (TIP: Place resistors in the longest BUS sections.)**
