**MDC-3**

## **Mini Door Contact (Brown)**

**Introduction**

The Mini Door Contact monitors the opening/closing of specified devices (e.g. door or window). The Door Contact is fixed to the monitored device frame with an actuating magnet fixed to the device. When the door or window opens, the magnet moves away from the Door Contact, activating an internal magnetic switch causing the Door Contact to transmit alarm signal to the Control Panel. The device also has the capabilities of communicating signal problems along with low battery situations.

The Door Contact design is consisted of a front cover and a back cover. The front cover(back) contains all electronics and the back cover provides a means for fixing the device. An enclosed PCB tamper switch provides tamper protection against unauthorized device opening.

## **Features**

### _**LED Indicator**_

In Normal operation mode, the LED indicator remains off except in the following situations when:

* When Door Contact’s Tamper switch is triggered.
* When the Door Contact is activated with either Tamper or Low battery condition.
* When the Door Contact is activated and transmitting the signal under the Test mode.

### _**Supervision**_

* The Door Contact will automatically transmit Supervisory signals periodically to the Control Panel at random intervals of 30 to 50 minutes in Normal Operation Mode.
* If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Door Contact for a preset period time, the Control Panel will indicate that particular Door Contact is experiencing an out-of-signal problem.

### _**Tamper Switch**_

* It is designed to protect against unauthorized, cover opening. When the tamper is triggered, Door Contact will emit a signal to the Control Panel for reporting, the LED will also light up.

### _**Battery**_

The MDC-3 uses one **3V CR2450 Lithium battery** as its power source

![](<.gitbook/assets/1 (20).jpeg>).

The Door Contact is also capable of detecting low battery. When the battery is low, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular transmission. The LED will light up when the Door Contact is activated under low battery status.

* **Changing Battery**

You need to open the cover to insert/remove the battery

(Please refer to _**Installation**_ on how to remove the Door Contact’s cover for details)

After the battery has been removed, press the Learn / Test button 5-6 times to fully discharge before inserting the new battery.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

Make sure the battery mark with the positive side (+) is faced upwards when inserting the battery.

Make sure to insert or place the battery from the top right angle in the Front Cover (Back) view
{% endhint %}

### _**Test Mode**_

The Door Contact can be put into Test mode for 3 minutes by pressing the Test Button on the front cover (back) once. During Test mode, the LED indicator will turn on upon triggering. Each press on the Test Button, the Door Contact will transmit a test signal to the Control Panel for radio range test and resets the test mode back to the 3-minute duration. It will exit Test Mode automatically after the 3 minutes and returns to Normal Operation mode.

### _**Getting Started**_

Step 1: Remove the battery insulator located at the rear side of the Door Contact.

Step 2: Put the Control Panel into learning mode, refer to Control Panel manual for detail.

Step 3: Press the Learn/Test Button on Door Contact to send signal to the Control Panel.

Step 4: If the Control Panel successfully receives the signal, the Control Panel should respond (e.g. emitting beeps). Refer to your Control Panel manual to complete the learning process.

Step 5: After the Door Contact is learnt-in, put the Control Panel into “**Walk Test**” mode, hold the Door Contact at the desired location, and press the Test button to confirm if this location is within signal range of the Control Panel.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with the Door Contact at the chosen location, proceed to _**installation**_.

## **Installation**

**To open the cover of the Door Contact:**

Step 1. Use a flat-headed screwdriver to fit into the cover opening hole on one side as (**Pic1**).

Step 2. Push the flat-headed screwdriver upwards as (**Pic2**).

Step 3. Turn to the other side and repeat Step 1 and Step 2.

Step 4. Once opened the cover, you can proceed to change the battery etc.

Step 5. To replace the cover:

* Make sure the Tamper Compression Mark is aimed at the Tamper Switch (Pic 3).
* Also make sure the bottom hooks of the back cover is latched on the bottom of the front cover (back) as (**Pic 4**)
* Fit the bottom hooks into the bottom latches of the front cover (back) then push it downwards as (1) in (**Pic 5**), then push forward (2) the entire back cover to close it until you hear a clip sound.
