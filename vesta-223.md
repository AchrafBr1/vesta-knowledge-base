## **Parts Identification**

1. **Light Sensor / LED Indicator**
   * Flashes every 4 seconds: low battery
2. **Battery Compartment**
3. **Learn / Test Button**
   * Press once to send a signal to the Control Panel.
4. **Temperature / Humidity Sensor**

## **Features**

### _**Lighting, Humidity and Temperature Monitoring**_

* The sensor measures illuminance, humidity and temperature to transmit measured data to the Control Panel regularly.

Illuminance reading is detected every 60 seconds.

Humidity and temperature reading is detected every 20 seconds. The sensor will transmit signal automatically when:

* The temperature changes by +/- 2Â°C.
* Humidity changes +/- 10%.
* When the current illuminance changes by +/- 10%.

### _**Battery**_

* The sensor uses one CR123 3V Lithium battery as its power source.
* The sensor features Low Battery Detection function. When the battery voltage is low, the sensor will transmit Low Battery signal to the Control Panel.
* When the battery is depleted, the LED flashes every 4 seconds and the sensor will stop all functions.
* When changing battery, after removing the old batteries, press the Learn/Status Button a few times to fully discharge before inserting new battery.

### _**Supervision**_

The sensor will transmit a supervision signal along with the reading signal to report its condition regularly. The factory default interval is 30-33 minutes.

## **Installation**

### _**Mounting the Sensor**_

The sensor can be mounted using two methods: Self-adhesive or Screw mounting.

#### **Self-adhesive mounting**

1. Clean the surface with a suitable degreaser.
2. Remove the protective covering from one side of double-sided adhesive pad and firmly apply to the back of the device.
3. Remove the other covering and firmly place/press the device in the desired location.
4. Do not use the Self-adhesive mounting method on poorly painted and/or rough surfaces.

#### **Screw Mounting**

The base of the sensor has two screw knockouts, where the plastic is thinner for mounting purposes. To mount the sensor:

1. Detach the Top Cover and Base assembly by loosening the Cover-Fixing Screw using a Philips screwdriver.
2. Break through the knockouts on the base.
3. Use the holes as a template to drill two holes and insert the wall plugs.
4. Screw the base into the wall plugs.
5. Replace the top cover over the base by hooking the base onto the fixing hook and pushing the cover towards the base.
6. Secure and screw the top cover back on to its base using a Philips screwdriver.
