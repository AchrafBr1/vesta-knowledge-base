Fall Sensor Series provides one of the most effective solutions to minimize the potential harm when the elderly fall. The sensitivity level of Fall Sensor-3 can be programmed on the control panel. Worn by users as neck pendants 24 hours a day, Fall Sensor automatically raises alarm calls to the monitoring center and activates the medical alarm to open two-way voice communication when falls have been detected. As one of significant causes of morbidity, falls may seriously affect senior people’s health.&#x20;

The fall detection reports from Fall Sensor make sure help arrives at the earliest possible time. Users can also press the button on Fall Sensor to summon help when in need.&#x20;

One of the smallest and most elegantly built of its kind on the market, Climax’s Fall Sensor series is designed to be light and comfortable. It contributes to the establishment of a complete telecare supervision network at any home.

This fall sensor is designed to activate the Control Panel by manual button press or auto fall detection to summon help in emergency condition.

## **Identifying the Parts**

1. **Lanyard Loop**
2. **Green/Red LED**
   * Green LED FLASH for 1 second: When powered on.
   * Green LED FLASH: Transmitting signal to the Control Panel.
   * Red LED FLASH: Transmitting signal to the Control Panel under low battery condition.
   * Red LED FLASH for 3 times: Low battery status detected when powered on.
3. **Active Button**
   * Press the Active Button to activate the Control Panel.
   * Press and hold the button for 8 seconds to cancel the alarm.
   * Press and hold the button for 8 seconds to receive sensitivity level data from the Control Panel.
4. **Battery Compartment Cover**
5. **Auto Low Battery Detection**
   * Fall Sensor features Auto Low Battery detection.
   * After the battery is inserted, the Fall Sensor will automatically check battery voltage and transmit battery status signal to the Control Panel every 24 hours. If Low Battery is detected 3 times in a row, the Fall sensor will enter low battery status and transmit low battery signal every 12 hours.
6. **Learn In Fall Sensor**
   * Step 1. Put the Control Panel into Learning Mode (Please refer to the Control Panel manual for details.)&#x20;
   * Step 2. Press the Button on Fall Sensor. A radio signal will be transmitted to the Control Panel.
   * Step 3. Please refer to the operation manual of your Control Panel to complete the learning process.

**7 . Battery**

The Fall Sensor uses one CR2477 3V lithium battery as its power source.

If the battery voltage is low, a Low Battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel to notify the user. Moreover, when activated under low battery status, the Red LED will flash to remind the user to replace the battery.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is prohibited to learn in Fall Sensor to Control Panel when it is in low battery status.

## **Sensitivity Level Adjustment**

The Fall Sensor sensitivity is programmable from the Control Panel. Five sensitivity levels are available for selection.

Level 1 refers to lowest sensitivity level, while Level 5 refers to highest sensitivity level.

| Sensitivity Level | Values         |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Level 1           | 130ms          |
| Level 2           | 110ms          |
| Level 3           | 90ms (default) |
| Level 4           | 70ms           |
| Level 5           | 50ms           |

{% hint style="info" %}
After setting the sensitivity level from the Control Panel, please press and hold the button on the fall sensor for 8 seconds to receive the sensitivity level data from the Control Panel. The LED (green under normal mode; red under low battery status) will light up upon receiving data from the Control Panel.
{% endhint %}

## **Inactivity Detection**

If a fall is detected, the sensor will transmit an alarm signal to Control Panel. If no sudden movement was detected within 10 seconds after fall detection, the Fall Sensor will transmit another inactivity code to Control Panel

## **Usage Recommendation**

* Best way to wear a fall sensor **(O)**
  1. Let it hang in front of the chest and adjust necklace length so that the sensor hangs at the bottom of the sternum as shown in the picture below.
  2. Wear the pendant exposed outside and in front of any clothes or heavy/feather jacket.

1. When a fall occurs, it is best if the fall sensor can touch the ground.
2. Wrong way to wear a fall sensor **(X)**
   1. Necklace being too short (around clavicle) or too long (below sternum) is likely to cause false trigger or no response.
   2. Fall sensor being worn inside a chest pocket will lead to non-detected condition.
3. Carefully place the fall sensor on a desk when you are not using it in order to avoid triggering a false alarm.
4. Due to the nature of fall detection mechanism, fall detection cannot be 100% accurate. False alarm or detection failure during daily use could not be avoided completely. Please utilize the Active Button to activate alarm manually when needed to ensure safety.
5. **Sleep Mode**
   * If the fall sensor remains stationary for more than 3 hours, it will enter Sleep Mode. If movement is detected during sleep mode, the fall sensor will start a 1-minute countdown to return to normal operation mode. Fall detection function is disabled during the 1-minute timer, and the user is allowed to put on the Fall Sensor without activating false alarm. When the 1-minute timer expires, the Fall Sensor will return to normal operation.
6. **Testing**

During testing, do not trigger the fall sensor twice within a 10-second interval.
