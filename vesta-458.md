### Key benefit

* Easy installation and operation, designed for quick installation by a single technician with no additional tools needed
* Even in the worst weather scenarios, you'll have more than 9 days of continuous operation without solar charging
* You can check charge levels and system status quickly from your cell phone to ensure optimal solar charging location at the time of installation
* Protected against vandalism or sabotage attempts with sensors that detect bumps, tilts and unauthorized openings
* Solar panel set at the perfect angle: its tilt is calculated to capture as much solar energy as possible, maximizing charging efficiency
