Note:

The Touchscreen Keypad is compatible with the Climax Video Door Phone (Vesta-109) and IP Camera. Up to 6 IP Cameras and VDPs are supported. Be sure to update the device and panel firmware to the latest version for compatibility.

Ensure your Control Panel, VDP, and Touchscreen Keypad are in the same Local Area Network (LAN). Moreover, both of the VDP and the Touchscreen Keypad should be added into the same Control Panel, or the devices will not be identified.
{% endhint %}

**Step 6.** You will enter the dashboard that displays the current date and time. Now you can access and control your Hub and smart devices directly on your Touchscreen Keypad.
