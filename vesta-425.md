**1. Introduction**

The TouchPanel-3 uses modern, intuitive user interface on a 7” full-color, high-resolution display, providing users quick access to security and smart home functions, as well as a quick on-screen control of all areas.

As an IP-based multifunctional RF, Z-Wave smart home gateway with WiFi, 4G/LTE, and Bluetooth capabilities, the TouchPanel-3 provides comprehensive solutions, including home security, visual verification, home automation, energy management, emergency monitoring, and remote management, for ultra-flexibility and convenience.

Moreover, the TouchPanel-3 features two-way hands-free communication through the built-in speaker and microphone.

Other innovative features include Bluetooth disarming, which allows users to conveniently disarm the security system even with their hands full. The face detection function enables the front camera to take photos when someone disarms the system, providing the basis for algorithm analysis to prevent potential harms.

**System Feature**

* **Two-way voice communication with VOIP and 4G/LTE**: Built-in microphone and speaker allows user to make hands-free voice call in case of emergency.

Additionally, the TouchPanel-3 automatically answers a callback call during callback timer.

* **Ethernet, WiFi, and/or 4G/LTE connection**:

The system can be connected through Ethernet, WiFi, or 4G/LTE. When all the three connection methods are available, the Panel prioritizes its connections in the following order: Ethernet > WiFi > 4G/LTE.

WiFi connection provides backup to Ethernet to extend system flexibility.

* **Voice Prompt Reminder**: The panel plays voice prompts upon system mode change to remind user the system status.
* **AI Recognition for alarm pictures:** The panel incorporates an AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm for recognizing whether an alarm image contains a person. Alarm images, along with the AI detection results, are transmitted to the CMS, enabling the CMS to prioritize the new alarm queue based on this AI detection.
* **Screen Timeout**: By default the screen of the TouchPanel-3 will automatically turn off after 5 minutes of inactivity. Tap anywhere on the screen to turn it on.

The user can also select the screen timeout period in Settings. If "Never" is selected, the screen will always stay on. Please refer to _**5. Settings**_.

* **Built-in accessory device**:

TSP-Cam: The panel features a built-in Camera, extra Cameras may be included into the system to extend the coverage.

**2.3. Power Supply**

**Power Adapter**

* A DC 5V 3A Type-C switching power adapter is required to connect to a wall outlet. Be sure only to use an adapter with the appropriate AC voltage rating to prevent component damage.
* The TouchPanel-3 will automatically turn on after power is supplied.

**Rechargeable Battery**

* In addition to the adapter, there is a rechargeable battery inside the Control Panel, which serves as a backup in case of a power failure.
* During normal operation, the AC power adapter is used to supply power to the Control Panel and at the same time recharge the battery.
* When the adapter is disconnected from the Control Panel, the Red LED will turn on to indicate AC power loss.
* When the battery level is low, the Touch Panel-3 will report a low battery status. If the AC power adapter is not reconnected after this report and the battery continues to drain, a warning message will appear on the user interface. If the battery becomes too low for the system to function, it will automatically shut down to protect data.

**3. Installation**

**3.1. System Deployment**

The Control Panel is designed to be wall mounted, follow guidelines below when planning installation location:

* The Control Panel requires the mains power and Ethernet connection.
* If a Cellular Module is used, ensure that there is good cellular coverage (Advisable to have a level of at least 4 out of 5).
* Avoid mounting the Control Panel near large metal objects which may affect wireless radio strength.
* The Control Panel should be protected by sensors so that no intruder can reach the Control Panel without first activating a sensor.
* When using routers to extend wireless communication coverage, remember to use only Routers with backup batteries for security sensors. If you use a Router without backup battery for security sensors, the Router will be powered down in case of AC failure, and you security sensors will lose connection with the Panel.

**3.2. Mounting**

The TouchPanel-3 is designed to be mounted on the wall.

It is recommended to fit the Panel at approximately chest height where the touchscreen can be easily accessed and operated.

1. The panel casing is secured by 2 bottom fixing screws. Loose the 2 fixing screws on the bottom to detach front cover from back plate.

1. **Panel Status**

* The dashboard provides at-a-glance view of Panel Status, Door Contact Status, and Device Status.
* The total number of door contacts and the total number of all devices will be displayed.
* If there is any fault or if there is any Door contact open, the total amount of faults / open Door Contacts will be displayed in a red circle on the upper right.

Tapping the red circle will pop up the fault list / the open DC devices list.

**4.2.1. Change System Mode**

* Tap the desired mode icon, e.g. Away Arm (Right).

Home Arm Disarm Away Arm

You will be required to enter one of the Control Panel User PIN Code to confirm the action.

The panel will play voice prompts upon system mode change to remind user the system status.

If incorrect PIN Code is entered, the TouchPanel-3 will display error message and arming will be aborted.

13

* When Arm Fault Type is set as Confirm, and the system has existing fault events when arming, the TouchPanel-3 will display fault message. If you still want to arm the system, you will need to bypass the faults on the fault list first or repeat the arming action within 30 seconds to Force Arm.

By checking all faults and tapping “Bypass”, the faults are bypassed and the system is armed now.

**Face Detection**

When the Face Detection feature is turned on, the system has to detect a face to disarm the system, adding an extra layer of protection. Please refer to _**5.1 Face Detection**_ to turn on the feature.

* When Disarm is tapped, the following dialog box will be displayed, requesting the user to

14

position his/her face in the camera frame to activate pin entering for disarming.

* The Panel will auto capture a photo when a face is detected and display the captured image for 3 seconds.
* After 3 seconds, the panel will display PIN code page with disarm icon. Enter the user PIN code to disarm the system.
* Whether disarming is completed or aborted, the captured face will be reported and displayed in the event log.

**4.2.2 Alarm Dashboard**

When there is an alarm, the Alarm dashboard will be displayed:

* **Area**: It will be indicated that the alarm is occurred in which area. When there are alarms in both areas, you can tap the icon to view the alarm list for each area respectively.
