**Step 1.** To learn a sensor into the Router, press and hold the test button of the Router for 3 seconds. Release the button when the Router emits one beep. The Router will enter “Learning Router/Sensor into Router” process and emit one long beep. The Green LED will begin to flash.

**Step 2.** Please refer to the device manuals on how to send learn code from the devices.

**For PIR Camera, please press the test button once to send a learn code to the Router.**

**Step 3.** When the Router receives signal sent from sensor, it will emit one long beep to confirm. If the sensor had already been added to the Router, it will emit 2 beeps to notify the user.

**A maximum of 60 devices (including routers) can be learnt into the Router, and up to 8 PIR cameras are supported. If the user attempts to learn in a 61st device, the Router will emit 4 beeps.**

<_NOTE_>

* To exit the current “Learning Router/Sensor into Router” process, press the test button once and the Router will emit 2 beeps and return to normal mode.
* If multiple routers are used, please only learn devices into the router(s) closest to the operation areas of the devices.
* All the devices learnt into the router must also be learnt into the Control Panel.

![](<.gitbook/assets/5 (87).png>)

* _**Operation**_

If the Router receives signal from a device, the Green LED will flash once and retransmit the signal to the Control Panel. The Red LED will flash once in transmission mode.

If the Router receives a signal from the Control Panel, the signal will be retransmitted to the corresponding device(s) from the Router.

_\<NOTE>_

* If the user fails to learn a sensor into the Control Panel first, the signal received cannot be retransmitted to the Control Panel. The Green LED will flash once and the device will emit 4 beeps.

![](<.gitbook/assets/6 (65).png>)

* _**Power Supply**_

The Router is powered by AC power. Plug the Router into a power socket to activate the Router. There is a rechargeable battery inside the Router that serves as a backup in case of a power failure. It takes approximately 72 hours to fully charge the battery. During normal operation, AC power is used to power the Router and at the same time recharge the battery.

![](<.gitbook/assets/7 (61).png>)

* _**Battery and Low Battery Detection**_

The Router is powered by four AAA 1.2V Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. After AC power failure, the Router will transmit a Low Battery signal to the Control Panel when low battery voltage is detected. To restore battery, re-plug AC power into the power socket.

* _**AC Failure Detection**_

2

Whenever the Router is removed from the power socket, the Router will transmit an AC Failure signal to the Control Panel to notify the situation. When the Router is re-plugged onto the power socket, it will transmit an AC restoration code.

* _**Supervision**_

After learnt into the Control Panel, the Router will automatically transmit Supervisory Signals every 30 to 50 minutes when working as a one-way device.

The Router will automatically transmit Supervisory Signals every 90 to 120 minutes when working as a two-way device.

* _**Factory Reset**_

Factory Reset function will clear all learnt-in device and Control Panel. To reset the Router, please follow steps below:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the test button for 3 seconds. Release the button when the Router emits one beep.

**Step 2.** The Router will enter “Learning Sensor into Router” process and emit one long beep. The Green LED will begin to flash.

**Step 3.** Press and hold the test button for another 5 seconds. Release the button when you hear 3 beeps.

**Step 4.** Factory reset is complete. All learn-in devices and Control Panel are cleared from the Router.

* _**Recommendations**_

It is strongly suggested to keep a distance between each router and the Control Panel to avoid cross signaling.

If a particular device is within an acceptable range for Control Panel to receive its transmission signal, it is strongly recommended to learn the device into the Control Panel directly instead of into the Router.

When cascading routers to form a transmission relay, it is strongly recommended to link not more than 2 layers of routers.

![](<.gitbook/assets/12 (47).png>)

_\<NOTE>_

* For devices that are directly controlled by the Panel to turn on/turn off, e.g. power switches, power meter switches, valve controllers, Roller Shutter Controls, or Input and Output Switches, please link **only one layer** of router(s).
* For keypad, it is also recommended to link **only one layer** of router(s).

**Multiple Routers**

If multiple routers are used, please follow the guidelines below for the optimum performance:

1. When linking routers to form a transmission replay, it is recommended to link not more than two layers of routers.

From the example below (Device to B to A to Control Panel), Router A, Router B, and the Device all need to be learned into the Control Panel.

The Device needs to be learned into its closest router (Router B). Router B needs to be learned into Router A. (Do not learn Router A into Router B.)

Example:

![](<.gitbook/assets/13 (31).jpeg>)

1. If a device is located between the RF coverage of multiple routers and the Control Panel: Example 1:

3

![](<.gitbook/assets/14 (27).jpeg>)

From the displayed diagram, the device is located between the RF coverage areas of Router B and C. Users can choose to learn the device into Router B only, learn into Router C only, or learn into both Routers B and C.

It is **recommended** to learn the device into Router B only (and not to Router C) to reduce signal traffic.

![](<.gitbook/assets/15 (36).png>)

_\<NOTE>_

* For the above system, Router C is also learnt into Router A or B or both so the signals from Router C can be relayed to the Control Panel through Router A or B, or either.

Example 2:

![](<.gitbook/assets/16 (17).jpeg>)

From the displayed diagram, the device is located between the RF coverage areas of Router A, B and C. Users can choose to learn the device into Router A only, learn into Router B only, learn into Router C only, or learn into Routers A, B and C.

It is **recommended** to learn the device into Router A only or Router B only (and not to Router

*
  1. to reduce signal traffic. _\<NOTE>_
     * For the above system, Router C is also learnt into Router A or B or both so the signals from Router C can be relayed to the Control Panel through Router A or B, or either.

1. Typically, most devices stay in the same RF coverage area. For the exceptions such as a Remote Controller, please learn the device into all Routers (and Control Panel) of the system.
