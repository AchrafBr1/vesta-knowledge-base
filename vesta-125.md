KPT-35-COMBO

## REMOTE KEYPAD

KPT-35-COMBO is a hardwired Remote Keypad designed to have quick access control of the System Control Panel via PIN Code or RFID tags. The keypad can send wired and wireless signals to and receive signals from the Control Panel within 500ft (152m) in wire distance. The LCD screen will display any information the system control panel sends back.

The Remote Keypad can either be mounted on a flat surface or wall with screws. It also has a tamper protection switch which will be activated upon any unauthorized attempt to open the back cover.

#### Caution

* Wiring of the Remote Keypad should only be performed by certified technician with proper knowledge and training in electric equipment.
* Before installation or any maintenance work, make sure the power supply of the Control Panel has been disconnected.

## Features

### _**Battery and Low Battery Detection**_

* Two L91 1.5V AA lithium batteries can be installed inside the battery compartment to serve as a backup power source in case of power failure. Prior to inserting batteries, ensure battery polarity is correct to protect your device.
* The Remote Keypad can also monitor battery life. When batteries are low on power, a low battery signal will be sent along with regular signal transmission to the Control Panel to alert users for battery replacement.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

Only use specified batteries with the device. When replacing batteries, always replace the whole set, do not mix different types of batteries or new and used ones to avoid damaging the device.
{% endhint %}

### _**Power Saving Feature**_

* When idle, the Remote Keypad is in **stand-by** mode and consumes no power. It will wake up when any key is pressed.
* After entering User Menu, if neither of the **Arm** key/**Home Arm** key is pressed, the Remote Keypad will return to **stand-by** mode within 5 seconds. If either or both of the **Arm** key/**Home Arm** key is/are pressed, the Remote Keypad will return to stand-by mode within **20** seconds.
* After “Enter PIN Code” is displayed on the LCD screen, if no key is pressed, the Remote Keypad will return to **stand-by** mode within 5 seconds.
* After the Mode Change request is submitted, if no signal is received from the Control Panel, the Keypad will return to **stand-by** mode within 15 seconds.
* Upon completion of a command input, the Remote keypad will return to **stand-by** mode.

### _**Keypad Wiring**_

* The keypad terminal can be hardwired to the Control Panel. Up to four KPT-35-COMBOs can be connected in series within 500ft (152m) in wire distance. Wire gauge: UTP, minimum 20 AWG, maximum 18 AWG.
* To connect KPT-35-COMBO to the Control Panel, open the front cover by using a Phillips screwdriver to loosen the cover fixing screw.
* Loosen KPT-35-COMBO’s “V” terminal and the Control Panel’s “VDD” terminal. Connect the “V” terminal to the “VDD” terminal and tighten both terminal screws.
* Loosen KPT-35-COMBO’s “G” terminal and the Control Panel’s “GND” terminal. Connect the “G” terminal to the “GND” terminal and tighten both terminal screws.
* Loosen KPT-35-COMBO’s “A” terminal and the Control Panel’s “458A” terminal. Connect the “A” terminal to the “458A” terminal and tighten both terminal screws.
* Loosen KPT-35-COMBO’s “B” terminal and the Control Panel’s “458B” terminal. Connect the “B” terminal to the “458B” terminal and tighten both terminal screws.
* Ensure the furthest keypad’s Jumper Switch and Control Panel’s J53 Jumper Switch are set to ON to serve as a terminating resistor.

![](<.gitbook/assets/4 (36).png>)

The Keypad Terminal can be hardwired to the Control Panel in series within 500ft (152m) in wire distance.

* KPT-35-COMBO-A is wired correctly as it is within 500ft (152m) of the Control Panel, in wire distance.
* KPT-35-COMBO-B is wired correctly as it is within 500ft (152m) of the Control Panel, in wire distance. Before tightening the cover fixing screw of the keypad, ensure its jumper switch is set to ON to serve as a terminating resistor since it has the furthest distance from the Control Panel.
* KPT-35-COMBO-C is NOT wired correctly as it is farther than 500ft (152m) from the Control Panel.

### _**Tamper Protection**_

* The Remote Keypad is protected against any unauthorized attempt to open the back cover with a tamper switch. When the back cover is opened, the tamper switch will be triggered and the Remote Keypad will transmit a tamper open signal to the system control panel.
* After replacing the back cover, the Remote Keypad will transmit a tamper restore signal to the system control panel.
* When the Remote Keypad is properly mounted with back cover screwed onto the wall, removing the Keypad forcefully will break off the back cover from the hollowed section around the screw location and activate tamper switch.

### _**Supervision Signal**_

* After installation, the Remote Keypad will automatically transmit Supervision Signals to the Control Panel at an interval of 30-50 minutes.
* If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Remote Keypad for a preset period of time, the Control Panel will consider the Remote Keypad out of order and react according to panel setting.

### _**RFID Configure**_

This function is for you to manage your RFID device (Tag)

* **RFID Learn:**

Up to 60 Tags can be learnt into the Remote Keypad. To learn the new RFID device into the Remote Keypad:

3. “Apply RFID” will be displayed on the LCD screen. Please put the tag close to the RFID sensor within 5 seconds.
4. When the Keypad detects the Tag, a long beep will be emitted, and the LCD display will prompt you to enter a PIN Code. Please enter a PIN Code for the tag, and press the OK key to confirm setting.
5. Learning is now complete. The Tag information has been added into the Keypad with corresponding PIN Code. You can now use the Tag to Arm/Home Arm/Disarm the Control Panel through the Remote Keypad.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

If a tag you wish to learn already exists in the Keypad, 2 beeps will be emitted when the Keypad detects the tag, and “RFID already Exist” will be displayed on the LCD screen.

When a RFID # that has been used for learning is selected, the corresponding PIN Code will be displayed on the LCD, allowing the user to edit the PIN Code directly.

The PIN Code length should be 4-6 digits. If you enter a PIN Code less than 4 digits, and press the OK key, the Keypad will emit 4 beeps, and “Incorrect PIN Code!" will be displayed on the LCD screen.
{% endhint %}

* **RFID Delete:**

To remove RFID devices stored in the Keypad:

1. In the User Menu, choose **Setting > RFID Config > RFID Delete**.
2. Use ▲ and ▼ key to select the RFID # for the RFID tag you want to remove, and then press the **OK** key to confirm selection.
3. “Are you sure” will be displayed on the LCD. Press the **OK** key delete the tag.
4. If you are not sure of the RFID # for the RFID tag you want to remove, put the tag you want to remove close to the RFID sensor. “Are you sure” will be displayed on the LCD. Press the **OK** key delete the tag.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

If a tag you wish to remove does not exist in the Keypad, “Incorrect RFID” will be displayed on the LCD screen when you swipe the tag.
{% endhint %}
