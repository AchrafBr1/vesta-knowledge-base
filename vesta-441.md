#### 3. Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
Solar panels need to face towards the sun to avoid shading by houses or trees.
{% endhint %}



* Find the round tube support and fix it to the screw holes of the I-frame/U-shaped frame of the solar panel with four square screws.

* **Pole installation:** Insert the two straps respectively into the upper and lower holes at the bottom of the battery bin (note: the upper and lower holes are 4), find the fixed position of the pole, tighten the arms and fix them firmly.

* **Wall hanging installation:** Use a marker to find four holes on the wall, drill holes with an electric drill, and secure them with expansion bolts (two on each side).

* **Install solar panels:** After the battery compartment is fixed, install the solar panels equipped with the round tube bracket, and find a good angle in the way of docking installation (note: the orientation of the battery compartment panel and solar panels must be the sunny side — due south/south to east/south to west; north installation is invalid), and fix it with 3 aircraft screws.

#### 5. Precautions / Common faults and repairs

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Precautions:**

1. The photovoltaic panel cannot be connected to other power sources or unmatched devices to avoid damage.
2. Photovoltaic panels and related devices should be firmly fixed to prevent falling due to wind.
3. Do not disassemble the product yourself, as it may affect maintenance (contains lithium battery, which must be recycled properly).
4. After full charge, battery can support 2–3 rainy days.
5. To forcibly shut down, press the “O” key of the switch — system stops working.
6. To start, press the switch; indicator turns green, and system begins operating.
{% endhint %}



**Common faults and repairs:**

1. Check if the switch is on
2. Check if the indicator light is green
3. Check connection lines or water ingress
4. Check if the panel and cables are connected properly
5. For issues, contact after-sales support
