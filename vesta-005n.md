**Features**

## _**Alarm Activation**_

When an alarm is activated, the Indoor Siren will sound continuously, and the LED indicator will flash continuously while the siren is alarming. If the alarm system control panel has programmed alarm duration, the Siren will be activated according to the panel alarm length. If the alarm system does not have alarm duration programmed, the Siren will be activated for 15 minutes.

If the system has alarms before, when the Control Panel disarms, the siren will play Voice Prompt:

_“You have a previous alarm.”_

## _**Audio Indication**_

The Indoor Siren emits different audio indications and voice prompts according to different status of the security system as listed in the table below.

You can change the volume of the indication voice sound between High, Medium and Low through the Control Panel. The factory default volume is set to Medium. Please refer to your control panel for details.

## _**Power Supply**_

The Siren is powered by AC power. Plug the Siren into a power socket to activate the Siren. The Siren will enter normal operation mode. For SRV-23B, there is a rechargeable battery inside the Siren that serves as a backup in case of a power failure. During normal operation, AC power is used to power the Siren and at the same time recharge the battery.

## _**Low Battery Detection**_

After AC power failure, the Siren will transmit a Low Battery signal to the Control Panel when a low battery voltage is detected. To restore the battery, re-plug the AC power into the power socket. After 12 hours, the Siren will transmit a low battery restored notification to the Control Panel.1

## _**AC Failure Detection**_

Whenever the Siren is removed from the power socket, the siren will transmit an AC fault signal to the Control Panel to notify users of the situation. The Siren will then switch to its internal battery for power supply.

When the Siren is re-plugged into the power socket, it will send an AC power restore signal to the Control Panel.

## _**Supervision**_

The Siren transmits a supervisory signal to the Control Panel once every 30-50 minutes during normal operation.

If this signal is not received with programmed duration, the Control Panel will indicate on its screen that the particular Siren is experiencing an out-of-order problem.

## **Getting Started**

1. Plug the Siren into the power socket. The LED will flash once to indicate it is now in normal operation mode.
2. Put the Control Panel into learning mode.
3. Press the button on the Siren once to transmit a learn code to the Control Panel. The Siren will emit one beep, and the LED will light up to indicate the siren is now in learning mode.
4. The learning mode of the siren will last as long as 1 minute.
5. If within 1 minute the siren receives an acknowledgement from the Control Panel, the Siren will emit four beeps and turn off the LED. Learning is now completed.
6. If within 1 minute the siren receives acknowledgement from the Control Panel and emits only one beep, it means the Siren has been previously learned into the Control Panel.
7. If after 1 minute the Siren does not receive an acknowledgement from the Control Panel, the siren will emit 5 beeps and turn off the LED. Learning is unsuccessful. Please repeat the learning process.

## **Programming the Siren**

Follow the instructions below to change the Siren Operation Area and edit the Siren settings in the Control Panel.

#### Step 1:  Use the panel Edit Device function to change the Siren area and program the device settings; press the OK button to confirm. The Siren will emit 3 beeps.

#### Step 2:  Press the test button on the Siren to send the signal to the Control Panel.

#### Step 3:  When the Siren receives acknowledgement signal from the Control Panel, it will emit 2 beeps to indicate the setting has been updated. The Siren will return to normal operation.

## **Factory Reset**

The siren can be reset and cleared of memory contents by following steps:

1. Remove the Siren from the Control Panel. Refer to the operation manual of your Control Panel for details.
2. Remove the Siren from the power socket and unplug the battery.
3. Press and hold the learn button while inserting the rechargeable battery then plugging the Siren into the power socket. If the battery can supply power, you can insert the battery only without plugging the Siren into the power socket.
4. Keep holding the button for about 7 seconds until the Siren emits 2 short beeps, then a long beep.
5. Release the button, factory reset is complete.
