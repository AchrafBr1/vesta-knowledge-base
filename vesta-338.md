* Speech reporting and SMS Text Report Format: **PhoneNumber**

Example: **0912345678**

**Speech Reporting**: When activated, Mobile Lite will dial to the telephone number and open two-way voice communication directly.

*
  * Speech reporting is for Emergency Event only. Status event will not be sent via speech.
  * Please note that Location info cannot be sent via Speech.
  * It is recommended to program at least one IP report before a Speech Report. The IP and speech reports each should be assigned to a separate Group. During two-way communication, Mobile Lite location info will be updated every minute, and at the same time reported via the last successful IP channel. (refer to _**6.5. Alarm Activation**_ for more details).

**SMS Text Reporting**: When activated, Mobile Lite sends a SMS text message to the recipient. The message contains event information and a Google Map link for location. If the recipient’s receiver device supports map function, he/she can click on the link to locate Mobile Lite.

**Event Filter**

This parameter determines which events are reported to the selected Report Destination.

1. options: “**All**”, “**Emergency**” and “**Status**”. When an event is triggered, it will be

17

reported to the reporting destination according to the setting. If set to **All**, the panel will report all events regardless of event type.

For example:

* Mobile Lite being low on battery is a “status” event. If report index 3 and 5 are set as “status” and index 4 as “all” in event filters, this status event will be reported to destinations 3, 4, and 5.
* For more information, refer to **8. Appendix** for event code types.

**Reporting Format (Type)**

The available reporting formats include:

* **Speech:** Mobile Lite reports over the Speech channel to allow the user to talk directly to the call recipient.
* **SIA\_CID over IP:** Mobile Lite reports digital CID event codes and location information over mobile network TCP Protocol in SIA format.
* **SIA2\_CID over IP:** Mobile Lite reports digital CID event codes and location information over mobile network TCP Protocol in SIA2 format.
* **SIA\_CID over UDP:** Mobile Lite reports digital CID event codes and location information over mobile network UDP Protocol in SIA format.
* **SIA2\_CID over UDP:** Mobile Lite reports digital CID event codes and location information over mobile network UDP Protocol in SIA2 format.
* **XML:** XML reporting in Avant Guard XML protocol.
* **SMS CID:** Mobile Lite sends a SMS text message containing event code and a location link.
* **SMS TEXT:** Mobile Lite sends a SMS text message containing event information and a location link.

**Group**

The Reporting Group determines the sequence of reporting.

One Report Index can only be assigned to one Group.

Reporting within a Group:

If there are multiple Report Indexes programmed within a Group:

* Mobile Lite will report according to the numeric order (e.g. 1 > 2 > 3, etc.) of the Report Index in a Group. Report will stop when one report is successful and Mobile Lite will regard reporting to this Group successful.

For example, if Report Index 1 and 4 are assigned to Group 1, Mobile Lite will stop reporting if reporting to Index 1 is successful. If reporting to Index 1

18

failed, Mobile Lite will carry on reporting to Index 4.

* If all reporting in a group failed, Mobile Lite will retry reporting.

Mobile Lite will try reporting within the same group for **up to three times**, (or until one of the reports is successful). If three times of trying within the same group failed, Mobile Lite will regard reporting to this Group unsuccessful.

From the example above, suppose all report failed, the report sequence would be:

1>4>1>4>1>4

Reporting Cycle

* If multiple groups are assigned to the same event type (emergency or status), Mobile Lite will report according the group numeric order from the first programmed Group to the last programmed group. This report sequence is one reporting cycle.
* Reporting cycle is regarded as successful if any Group is successful, but Mobile Lite will terminate reporting only after completing the reporting cycle (going from the first programmed group to the last programmed group).
* Reporting behavior depends on the event type:
  * **Emergency Events**:
    * When reporting to the first group is successful, Reporting is regarded as successful. Mobile Lite will still report to the next group until all groups have been tried to complete the reporting cycle.

For example, Groups 1 and 3 are assigned to Emergency Events:

If Group 1 is successful, Mobile Lite will still report to Group 3.

If reporting to Group 3 is successful, Mobile Lite will terminate reporting.

If reporting to Group 3 is unsuccessful (going through all the Report Indexes within the group for 3 times), Mobile Lite will also terminate reporting.

* When reporting to the first group failed (going through all the Report Indexes within the group for 3 times), Mobile Lite will start reporting to the next group. When reporting to the second group succeeds, reporting is regarded as successful. If no other group is programmed, Mobile Lite will stop reporting. If there are more groups programmed, Mobile Lite will continue reporting until all groups have been tried to complete the reporting cycle.
* If reporting to all the programmed groups failed in a reporting cycle, Mobile Lite will wait for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, Mobile

19

Lite will retry as it starts another reporting cycle.

For Emergency event, Mobile Lite will try reporting for up to three reporting cycles. If going through three reporting cycles and all failed, Mobile Lite will terminate reporting.

Example 1, if Groups 1 and 3 are programmed for “Emergency” reports, and assuming NO successful report until Group 1 is successful after the second try:

Group 1 > Group 3 > Wait 5 minutes > Group 1 (Success!) > Group 3 > Stops reporting whether Group 3 is successful or not.

Example 2, if Groups 1 and 3 are programmed for “Emergency” reports, and assuming there is NO successful report:

Group 1 > Group 3 > Wait 5 minutes > Group 1 > Group 3 > Wait 5 minutes > Group 1 > Group 3 > Stops reporting

* **Status Events**:

Mobile Lite will only go through one reporting cycle for Status reports.

For example, if Groups 1 and 3 are programmed for “Status” reports:

Group 1 > Group 3 > Stops reporting whether Groups 1 and 3 succeeded or not

When Mobile Lite is being charged, the Red LED will not indicate the battery status.

If Mobile Lite is activated while having a Cellular Network fault (Amber LED flashes once every 3 seconds), it will emit 3 beeps as a local warning.

**6.3. GPS/Wi-Fi Locate Function**

* Mobile Lite location info can be acquired in 3 ways.
  1. **Activate an alarm**

When an alarm is activated, Mobile Lite will also report its location info along with the alarm event. (For IP & SMS Reporting)

During two-way communication following a successful IP report, Mobile Lite location info will be updated every minute, and reported via the previously successful IP channel. (For Speech Reporting)

*
  1. **Auto Check-In Report**

When the Mobile Lite makes the auto check-in report to CMS, its location info will also be updated and sent with the report.

*
  1. **Send SMS command LOC**

If the SMS Command LOC is correct and successfully received, Mobile Lite will report location info to programmed report destination and the sender of the SMS command according to command selection. Refer to _**8.1 SMS Remote Programming Commands Table**_ for more details.

* For IP reporting, the Location coordinates will be included in SIA\_CID and XML event reports.
* For SMS reporting, the location info is sent as a webpage link for Google Map. Click the link to display the location.

38

* For Speech reporting, the location info will be updated every minute, but it cannot be sent via Speech reporting format.

You will need to program at least one IP report before Speech report. Mobile Lite location updates during two-way communication will be reported through the last successful IP channel.

* If Mobile Lite is under low battery and makes a second low battery report to the CMS, the location function will be turned off.

**6.4. GeoFencing**





The installer can setup a GeoFence area for the user to do everyday activity.

When GeoFencing is enabled, Mobile Lite will check its location every 2 minutes.

* If the user leaves the GeoFence area and is detected while Mobile Lite is checking its location, it will automatically report to the report destinations.
* If the user returns to the GeoFence area, it will also send restoration report to the report destinations.
* When Mobile Lite makes a second low battery report to the CMS, the GPS function is turned off and GeoFence function will also be turned off.

39

**6.5.** **Alarm Activation**

* When an alarm is activated by pressing the Active Button of Mobile Lite or the learnt-in RF device (WTR, Fall Sensor or PB), or pulling the cord of PCU, Mobile Lite will emit a voice prompt “Emergency Call was pressed” as it enters guard time.
* When a fall is detected from the learnt-in Fall Sensor or the Mobile Lite itself, Mobile Lite will enter guard time fall sensor and begin report when guard time for fall sensor expires.
* If Mobile Lite is activated while having a Cellular Network fault (Amber LED flashes once every 3 seconds), it will emit 3 beeps as a local warning.
* If there are no report destinations programmed, Mobile Lite will not report upon alarm activation and will emit 1 beep as a reminder.
* Mobile Lite will also report its location along with the alarm report (please refer to _**6.3. GPS/Wi-Fi Locate Function**_) provided the programmed report method(s) supports location report.

**Guard Time**

* After Mobile Lite is activated, it will begin counting down the Guard Time and begin reporting after Guard Time has expired. Mobile Lite will continuously play voice prompt “Help call in progress” during guard time.
* During guard time, the user can cancel the alarm reporting by pressing the Active Button of Mobile Lite for 5 seconds or pressing the Active Button of the learnt-in RF device for a duration determined by the device (please refer to the device user manual). If alarm is canceled, Mobile Lite will play voice prompt “Help call cancelled”.
* Alarm cannot be cancelled after guard time has expired.

**Guard Time Fall Sensor**

* When a fall is detected from the learnt-in Fall Sensor or the Mobile Lite itself, Mobile Lite will enter guard time for fall sensor.
* If a false alarm is triggered by Fall Detection, it can be canceled within the guard time fall sensor period by pressing the Active Button of Mobile Lite for 5 seconds or pressing the Active Button of the learnt-in RF device for a duration determined by the device (please refer to the device user manual).
* After the Guard Time for Fall Sensor has expired, Mobile Lite will begin report, and the alarm event cannot be cancelled after Guard Time for Fall Sensor has expired.
* This function is only used when a fall is detected, if the Active Button on Mobile Lite or the Active Button of the learnt-in Fall Sensor is pressed to activate alarm, normal guard time is used instead.

**Confirmation Beeps**

40

* After guard time expires, Mobile Lite will summon help based on the programmed reporting methods. When Mobile Lite is reporting, it will emit confirmation beeps (1 beep every second).
* For Speech Reporting, if the call recipient picks up the call, Mobile Lite will stop beeping. It will start emitting confirmation beeps again when reporting is resumed (e.g. report to the next report destination).

**Silent Mode**

* When Mobile Silent function is enabled and Mobile Lite is under Silent Mode, it will not play any voice prompt or emit confirmation beeps during alarm reporting under Silent Mode.

**Last Location**

The Last Location function determines Mobile Lite reporting behavior when activated. Please refer to **4.1.6. Settings** for programming **Use Last Position** setting.

* When Enabled, Mobile Lite will regularly scan for nearby Wi-Fi hotspots, other wireless access points and store the data according set time interval. If Wi-Fi data cannot be obtained, Mobile Lite will check GPS location instead.

When Mobile Lite is activated to send alarm report, it will begin to check last position while acquiring new Location. If new location cannot be acquired by the time Guard Time ends, Mobile Lite will send report with last location. After new location is acquired, Mobile Lite will send another report to update the location info.

_\<NOTE>_

*
  * Mobile Lite will check Last Location by transmitting last stored Wi-Fi hotspot data to Google Wi-Fi positioning service for location identification or using last acquired GPS location if there is any. (GPS function is only turned on when no Wi-Fi hotspot data is obtained.)
  * Mobile Lite will disregard Last location if it is older than 8 hours.
* When Disabled, Mobile Lite will NOT scan for nearby Wi-Fi hotspots or check GPS location regularly. When Mobile Lite is activated to send a report, if new location cannot be acquired by the time Guard Time ends, Mobile Lite will send report without location. After new location is acquired, Mobile Lite will send another report to update the location info.

41

**6.5.1. Alarm Report Procedure**

Mobile Lite alarm and location reporting sequence is determined by **Use Last**

**Position** setting.

* **Use Last Position **_**Disabled**_

When Mobile Lite button is pressed for 2 seconds and alarm is activated, it will begin to acquire new Location (through Wi-Fi and GPS positioning) and count down Guard Time.

*
  * If new Location is acquired within Guard Time, Mobile Lite will make alarm report (event code 100/101/120) along with location coordinates when Guard Time expires.
  * If new Location is not acquired by the time Guard Time expires, Mobile Lite will make alarm report (event code 100/101/120) with no location info.

After new position is acquired, Mobile Lite will follow up with another report in event code 645.

If new position is acquired, and it’s in two-way communication following a successful IP report, Mobile Lite will make report in event code 100/101/120 with location info via the previously successful IP channel. Mobile Lite will keep updating and reporting location info every minute in event 100/101/120 before two-way communication ends.

**Example:**

1. If Guard Time = 30 seconds, new Location acquired within Guard Time:

Mobile Lite makes alarm report (CID 100/101/120) upon Guard Time expiry along with new Location coordinates.

1. If Guard Time = 30 seconds, new Location is NOT acquired within Guard Time:

Mobile Lite makes alarm report (CID 100/101/120) upon Guard Time expiry without Location coordinate.

*
  1. When new position is acquired, Mobile Lite makes follow up report (CID 645) immediately with Location coordinates.
  2. If new position is acquired under two-way communication following a successful IP report, Mobile Lite makes report (CID 100/101/120) via the successful IP channel with location coordinates.

During the two-way communication, Mobile Lite will keep updating location and making report (CID 100/101/120) every minute.

* **Use Last Position **_**Enabled**_

When this function is Enabled, Mobile Lite will regularly scan for nearby Wi-Fi hotspots, other wireless access points and store the data according set time

42

interval. If Wi-Fi data cannot be obtained, Mobile Lite will check GPS location instead.

When Mobile Lite button is pressed for 2 seconds and alarm is activated, it will begin to check last position while acquiring new Location and count down Guard Time.

* Mobile Lite will check Last Location by transmitting last stored Wi-Fi hotspot data to Google Wi-Fi positioning service for location identification or using last acquired GPS location. (GPS function is only turned on when no Wi-Fi hotspot data is obtained.)
* Mobile Lite will acquire new location using Wi-Fi and GPS positioning.
  * If new location is acquired within guard time, the alarm report (event code 100/101/120) is made immediately with the new location coordinates.
  * If new location is not acquired by the time Guard Time ends, Mobile Lite will send report (event code 100/101/120) with last location.

If there is no Last Location data stored, or it is older than 8 hours, Mobile Lite will disregard it and send report (event code 100/101/120) without location.

After new position is acquired, Mobile Lite will follow up with another report in event code 645.

If new position is acquired, and it’s in two-way communication following a successful IP report, Mobile Lite will make report in event code 100/101/120 with location info via the previously successful IP channel. Mobile Lite will keep updating and reporting location info every minute in event 100/101/120 before two-way communication ends.

**Example:**

1. If Guard Time = 30 seconds, new Location acquired within Guard Time:

Mobile Lite makes alarm report (CID 100/101/120) upon Guard Time expiry along with new Location coordinates.

1. If Guard Time = 30 seconds, new Location is NOT acquired within Guard Time:
   1. If Mobile Lite has Last Location, it makes alarm report (CID 100/101/120) along with location coordinates after Guard Time has expired.
   2. If Mobile Lite does not have Last Location, or the Last Location is older than 8 hours, it makes alarm report (CID 100/101/120) without Location coordinates after Guard Time has expired.
   3. When new position is acquired, Mobile Lite makes follow up report (CID 645) immediately with Location coordinates.

43

1. If new position is acquired under two-way communication following a successful IP report, Mobile Lite makes report (CID 100/101/120) via the successful IP channel with location coordinates.

During the two-way communication, Mobile Lite will keep updating location and making report (CID 100/101/120) every minute.

**6.5.2. Callback Mode**

* After reporting an alarm successfully to the CMS, Mobile Lite R23 will enter callback mode by default. User can choose to turn on/off the Callback feature and set call back mode time length (Please refer to _**4.1.6. Settings**_).

_\<NOTE>_

* Mobile Lite R23 will enter callback mode only after all groups have been reported to and at least one report was successful.
* When a caller calls back within the period, Mobile Lite R23 will auto answer the call after 2 beeps, and depending on the setting of “Callback Check Access Code”, Mobile Lite will check the Access Code or not before it opens a full-duplex Two-way communication.
* If the number of the incoming call matches any of the Caller ID, Mobile Lite R23 will instantly pick up the call, emit one beep (at the caller handset) and open a two-way communication (without checking Access Code).





The caller can call back multiple times during the callback period.

The caller can use the following DTMF commands to control the call:

* Enter (**1**) for talk-only mode.
* Enter (**2**) for two-way voice communication.
* Enter (**3**) for listen-in only mode.
* Enter (**9**) to hang up.
* Put the handset back to the base cradle to end the call.
* Press and hold the Active Button of Mobile Lite for 5 seconds, or press Active Button of RF device (WTR, Fall Sensor or PB) once to end the call.
* Press any DTMF key except for the designated hang-up key (**9**) to reset the communication time to its preset duration. When a DTMF key is pressed, its designed shortcut function will also be executed along with the communication time reset.

_\<NOTE>_

* If you wish to enable a designed shortcut function, please press the DTMF key for at least 1 second.
* The function of pressing sensor button to end call is now programmable via PC Programming Tool or SMS command. Default is disabled.

45

**6.5.3. Speech Reporting Method**

* If speech reporting method is selected, Mobile Lite R23 will dial the programmed number for reporting. It will establish a two-way voice communication between the call recipient and Mobile Lite user for a duration based on the setting of two-way timer.
* At 20 and 10 seconds before the communication time expires, Mobile Lite R23 will emit 1 beep via the telephone handset to alert the user.
* If the call recipient needs more talk time, he can press any key except for (**9**) to reset the communication time to its preset duration.
* The CMS can remotely control Mobile Lite during the voice communication period using the DTMF commands below:
  * Enter (**1**) for talk-only mode.
  * Enter (**2**) for two-way voice communication.
  * Enter (**3**) for listen-in only mode.
  * Enter (**9**) to hang up.
* When a DTMF key is pressed, its designed shortcut function will also be executed along with the communication time reset.
* The CMS call recipient can also put the handset back to the base cradle to end the call. Mobile Lite user can press and hold Mobile Lite’s Active Button for 5 seconds or press the sensor button once (when enabled) to end the call.

_\<NOTE>_

* If Mobile Silent is enabled on Mobile Lite, a Listen-In only communication will be established instead; however, the call recipient can press DTMF keys (as listed above) to change modes.
* If the Speech Report Ack is set to “**Off Hook**”, Mobile Lite R23 will consider the Speech Report successful when the call recipient picks up the call.
* If the Speech Report Ack is set to “**Any DTMF**”, Mobile Lite R23 will consider the Speech Report successful when the call recipient has entered any DTMF command.
* If the report was unsuccessful, Mobile Lite will keep on dialing the CMS number according to Report Retry Method.
* During two-way communication, Mobile Lite R23’s location info will be updated every minute; if there was a successful IP report before the current two-way communication, the location updates will be reported in event code 100/101/120 via the previously successful IP channel.

46

**6.5.4. Report Sequence**

The Reporting Group determines the sequence of reporting.

One Report Index can only be assigned to one Group.

Reporting within a Group:

If there are multiple Report Indexes programmed within a Group:

* Mobile Lite will report according to the numeric order (e.g. 1 > 2 > 3, etc.) of the Report Index in a Group. Report will stop when one report is successful and Mobile Lite will regard reporting to this Group successful.

For example, if Report Index 1 and 4 are assigned to Group 1, Mobile Lite will stop reporting if reporting to Index 1 is successful. If reporting to Index 1 failed, Mobile Lite will carry on reporting to Index 4.

* If all reporting in a group failed, Mobile Lite will retry reporting.

Mobile Lite will try reporting within the same group for **up to three times**, (or until one of the reports is successful). If three times of trying within the same group failed, Mobile Lite will regard reporting to this Group unsuccessful.

From the example above, suppose all report failed, the report sequence would be:

1>4>1>4>1>4

Reporting Cycle

* If multiple groups are assigned to the same event type (emergency or status), Mobile Lite will report according the group numeric order from the first programmed Group to the last programmed group. This report sequence is one reporting cycle.
* Reporting cycle is regarded as successful if any Group is successful, but Mobile Lite will terminate reporting only after completing the reporting cycle (going from the first programmed group to the last programmed group).
* Reporting behavior depends on the event type:
  * **Emergency Events**:
    * When reporting to the first group is successful, Reporting is regarded as successful. Mobile Lite will still report to the next group until all groups have been tried to complete the reporting cycle.

For example, Groups 1 and 3 are assigned to Emergency Events:

If Group 1 is successful, Mobile Lite will still report to Group 3.

If reporting to Group 3 is successful, Mobile Lite will terminate

47

reporting.

If reporting to Group 3 is unsuccessful (going through all the Report Indexes within the group for 3 times), Mobile Lite will also terminate reporting.

* When reporting to the first group failed (going through all the Report Indexes within the group for 3 times), Mobile Lite will start reporting to the next group. When reporting to the second group succeeds, reporting is regarded as successful. If no other group is programmed, Mobile Lite will stop reporting. If there are more groups programmed, Mobile Lite will continue reporting until all groups have been tried to complete the reporting cycle.
* If reporting to all the programmed groups failed in a reporting cycle, Mobile Lite will wait for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, Mobile Lite will retry as it starts another reporting cycle.

For Emergency event, Mobile Lite will try reporting for up to three reporting cycles. If going through three reporting cycles and all failed, Mobile Lite will terminate reporting.

Example 1, if Groups 1 and 3 are programmed for “Emergency” reports, and assuming NO successful report until Group 1 is successful after the second try:

Group 1 > Group 3 > Wait 5 minutes > Group 1 (Success!) > Group 3 > Stops reporting whether Group 3 is successful or not.

Example 2, if Groups 1 and 3 are programmed for “Emergency” reports, and assuming there is NO successful report:

Group 1 > Group 3 > Wait 5 minutes > Group 1 > Group 3 > Wait 5 minutes > Group 1 > Group 3 > Stops reporting

* **Status Events**:

Mobile Lite will only go through one reporting cycle for Status reports and will not retry if report failed.

For example, if Groups 1 and 3 are programmed for “Status” reports: Group 1 > Group 3 > Stops reporting

48

**6.6.** **Airplane Mode**

You can use Airplane Mode to turn off the wireless features and fall detection function on your Mobile Lite R23 while you're flying in an airplane.

Press the Active Button for 20 seconds in normal operation mode, Mobile Lite R23 will enter Airplane Mode. Mobile Lite R23 will emit a voice prompt “Power Off” as an indication of it entering Airplane Mode.

When in Airplane Mode, all wireless functions, including RF communication, LTE Reporting, and the fall detection function, are disabled.

To leave Airplane Mode, press the Active Button for 20 seconds, Mobile Lite R23 will emit a beep to indicate it exits Airplane Mode and returns to normal operation mode.

**6.7. Sleep Mode**

Sleep Mode can be enabled or disabled (default) in the Settings tab. When Sleep Mode is enabled, if no movement (at least 10 steps) is detected for 15 minutes, the Mobile Lite R23 will automatically enter Sleep Mode to conserve battery power.

During Sleep Mode, Mobile Lite R23’s cellular module will be powered off, while the RF communication and Fall Detection function will keep working.

No status report will be transmitted in sleep mode.

In order to send alarm report to CMS, Mobile Lite R23 will power on its cellular module and leave sleep mode when it receives any RF signal, detects a fall, or when the active button is pressed.

Mobile Lite R23 will also leave sleep mode when it starts charging, or when it detects movement (at least 10 steps).

_\<NOTE>_

When in Airplane Mode and Sleep Mode, Mobile Lite cannot answer any incoming call or callback call, and remote firmware update is NOT allowed for the duration.

49

**6.8. Usage Recommendation for Fall Detection**

When the fall detection function is enabled for Mobile Lite, please wear the unit on the neck and let it hang in front of the chest, so that Fall Sensor can be effectively triggered. Please **do not** wear the Mobile Lite on your belt, place it in your bag, or hide it inside coat pocket, which may lead to difficult trigger or non-detection of a fall.

* Best way to wear Mobile Lite as a fall sensor **(O)**
  1. Let it hang in front of the chest and adjust necklace length so that the sensor hangs at the bottom of the sternum as shown in the picture below.
  2. Expose the pendant outside and in front of any clothes or heavy/feather jacket.
*
  1. When a fall occurs, it is best if Mobile Lite can touch the ground.
* Wrong way to wear Mobile Lite **(X)**
  1. Necklace being too short (around clavicle) or too long (below sternum) is likely to cause false trigger or no response.
  2. Mobile Lite being worn inside a chest pocket or placed in a bag will lead to non-detected condition.
* Carefully place the Mobile Lite on a desk when you are not using it in order to avoid triggering a false alarm.
* Due to the nature of fall detection mechanism, fall detection cannot be 100% accurate. False alarm or detection failure during daily use could not be avoided completely. Please utilize the Active Button to activate alarm manually when needed to ensure safety.

50

**6.9.** **Voice Prompts**

Mobile Lite will play voice prompts according to different conditions.

Voice prompts can be turned on/off using SMS remote programming.

Below is a quick reference chart of all the voice prompts of Mobile Lite and the conditions under which they are played.

**7.2.** **Contact ID Communications Protocol and Format**

Mobile Lite can communicate with the CMS receiver using the Contact ID protocol. The CMS can receive the event codes using SMS or IP reporting methods.

The form of the CID message is:

**IP Reporting Data Format**

**\[ACCT** \<space>**MT QXYZ GG CCC S1S2S3S4] \[ ]** All data inside bracket will be processed. **ACCT** = 4 Digit Account number (0-9, B-F) **\<space>** = Delimited for ACCT and MT.

**MT** =

**Q** = Event qualifier, which gives specific event information:

1 = New Event or Opening

3 = New Restore or Closing

6 = Previously reported condition still present (Status report)

**XYZ** = Event code (3 Hex digits 0-9, B-F)

1. \= Group or Partition number (2 Hex digits 0-9, B-F). Use 00 to indicate that no specific group or partition information applies.
2. \= Zone number (Event reports) or User # (Open/Close reports) (3 Hex digits 0-9, B-F). Use 000 to indicate that no specific zone or user information applies.

**S1S2S3S4 =** Using the 8-bit Fletcher Checksum Algorithm

**SMS Reporting Data Format**

**ACCT\<space>MT\<space>QXYZ\<space>GG\<space>CCC\<space>SSSS ACCT** = 4 Digit Account number (0-9, B-F) **\<space>** = Delimited for ACCT and MT.

**MT** = Message Type. This 2-digit sequence is used to identify the Contact ID message to the receiver. It may be transmitted as either 18 (preferred) or 98 (optional). New receiver implementations shall accept either an 18 or a 98. Note that some older receivers may not accept 98.

**\<space>** = Delimited for MT and Q

**Q** = Event qualifier, which gives specific event information:

3 = New Restore or Closing

6 = Previously reported condition still present (Status report)

56

**XYZ** = Event code (3 Hex digits 0-9, B-F)

**\<space>** = Delimited for XYZ and GG

1. \= Group or Partition number (2 Hex digits 0-9, B-F). Use 00 to indicate that no specific group or partition information applies.

**\<space>** = Delimited for GG and CCC

1. \= Zone number (Event reports) or User # (Open/Close reports) (3 Hex digits 0-9, B-F). Use 000 to indicate that no specific zone or user information applies.

**\<space>** = Delimited for CCC and SSSS

1. \= Using the 8-bit Fletcher Checksum Algorithm _\<NOTE>_

* The Checksum is calculated up to CCC (including space).

The category to which each event belongs is shown in the brackets following every event description. The event filter (please refer to **4. Programming Mobile Lite – SMS Remote Programming** for details about the event filter) will process events according to the categories to which events are assigned.

For example, in the case of “100 – Mobile Lite Emergency (medical)”, “medical” means the category to which the event “Mobile Lite Emergency” is assigned.

_\<NOTE>_

* Apart from CID\_IP and CSV\_IP reporting types, Mobile Lite will report its current location along with other reports.

**Event Codes:**

* **100 – Mobile Lite Emergency (emergency)**
  * When the Active Button of Mobile Lite is pressed for 2 seconds (“Help Event” set as 100).
  * Location info will be sent with event 100.
* **101 – Personal Emergency (emergency)**
  * When the Active Button of Mobile Lite is pressed for 2 seconds (“Help Event” set as 101).
