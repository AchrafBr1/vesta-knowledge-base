**Universal Transmitter (UT-15SL / UT-15SL-NT)**

Universal Transmitter monitors the opening/closing of specified device that is connected to it. If any alarm is triggered by the connected device, the Universal Transmitter transmits the alarm signal to Control Panel to notify users of an alarm event.

Universal Transmitter design consists of a cover and base. The cover contains all electronics and the base provides a means for fixing the device.

The Universal Transmitter includes two models according to availability of tamper switch.

UT-15SL: Tamper switch available

UT-15SL-NT: Tamper switch removed

_\<NOTE >_

* After you have set one function by sliding the DIP switch, you have to press Test Button to confirm the setting.
* Only **1** switch of Dip Switch 1\~4 & 8 can be set to ON position at a time.

## _**Accessories Included**_

2 White Caps

2 Screws

2 Wall Plugs

## _**LED Indicator**_

The LED will light up in the following situations:

* When the Universal Transmitter is activated by the connected device
* When the cover is opened and the tamper switch is violated
* When the learn/test button is pressed to transmit test signals
* When the battery is exhausted, the LED flashes once every 4 seconds

## _**Battery**_

* The Universal Transmitter uses one **CR2 3V Lithium battery** as its power source. Please note: **ALWAYS** replace battery with the correct size and voltage.
* When the Universal Transmitter is low in battery, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular supervisory signal transmissions for the Control Panel to display the status accordingly.
* When changing batteries, after removing the old batteries, press the Tamper Switch twice to fully discharge before inserting new batteries.

## _**Supervisory Signal (when the Dip Switch 5 is ON)**_

* After installation, UT-15 will automatically transmit Supervisory Signals periodically to the Control Panel at random intervals of 30-50 minutes.
* Failure of the Control Panel to receive a preset Device Contact signal, the Control Panel will display that the particular device is experiencing an out-of-signal problem.

## _**Getting Started**_

* Remove the fixing screw and cover assembly.
* Insert the “**CR2 3V**” battery into the battery holder and connect the polarity correctly.
* Choose the type of connected device by sliding one Dip Switch on Universal Transmitter (Dip Switch 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8) to ON position and then press Test button to confirm the setting.
* Put the Control Panel into learning mode (refer to Control Panel manual for detail).
* Press the Universal Transmitter’s test button.
* Refer to Control Panel manual to complete the learn-in process.
* After the Universal Transmitter is learned-in, place the Control Panel into (**Walk Test**) mode, hold the transmitter at desired location, and press the Test button to test the signal range.
* Proceed with mounting and installation once you are satisfied that UT-15 is located and functions properly.

## _**Mounting Methods and Installation**_

<div align="left"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (107).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Step 1: Find a suitable location for mounting.

Step 2: Mounting:

Use the mounting holes on the transmitter as a template of appropriate hole positioning.

Use the provided wall plugs for plaster/brick installation.

Screw the transmitter into the provided wall plugs.

_< Note >_

* Ensure the tamper switch spring is positioned so that it is in contact with the mounting surface through the tamper switch aperture.

Step 3: Put the Control Panel into (**Walk Test**) Mode, and press the Test Button to test the signal range

Step 4: Fit the white caps to the two mounting holes, and the installation is now complete.

## _**Using the Extension Terminal 1 (CON 4)**_

The Extension Terminal 1 of Universal Transmitter can be connected to a device to form an N.O. or N.C. loop with the device. When the device is activated, the Universal Transmitter will transmit signals accordingly.

## _**CONNECTION TO EXTENSION TERMINAL:**_

Step 1: Open the cover by loosening the fixing screw.

Step 2: Locate a rectangular through-hole on the upper end of the front case. This through-hole allows the wiring connection to the Extension Terminal. Connect the wired device to the extension terminal.

Step 3: Use Dip Switch 6 to select the N.O. or N.C. setting for Extension Terminal 1.

_\<NOTE >_

* After you have selected the N.O. or N.C. setting with DIP Switch 6, you have to press the Test Button once, and operate once the device of Extension Terminal 1 (CON 4) to effectively change the state of CON 4.

Step 4: Activate the connected device to test the signal transmission.

* For multiple device wiring, refer to the diagram below.

**N.C.** **N.O.**

## _**Using the Extension Terminal 2 (CON5)**_

The Extension Terminal 2 can be triggered by the rotations of the axle. Connect the roller shutter to Extension Terminal 2 to use this function.

_\<NOTE >_

* The Extension Terminal 2 (CON 5) can be functioned only when the Dip Switch 1 is set to ON (the Door Contact type).
*   When the pull cord is pulled down or retracted, it will cause the axles to rotate. Options are available for alarm trigger with 5- or 8-axle rotations.



    * 5-axle rotations are about 9.5 cm.
    * 8 axle rotations are about 13 cm.



<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (106).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* When the Pulse does not achieve the number of triggered times in 10 sec, the count will reset.
* The times of Pulse, which causes the terminal 2 alarm to be triggered, can be programmed by Dip Switch 7 setting.
