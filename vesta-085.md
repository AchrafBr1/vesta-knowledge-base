* Slim Door Contact (SDC-1) User Manual

The Slim Door Contact monitors the opening/closing of specified devices (e.g. door or window). The Door Contact is fixed to the monitored device frame with an actuating magnet fixed to the device. When the door or window opens, the magnet moves away from the Door Contact, activating an internal magnetic switch causing the Door Contact to transmit alarm signal to the Control Panel. The device also has the capabilities of communicating signal problems along with low battery situations.

1. **LED Indicator**
2. **Learn/Test Button**

\*(Use a sharp tool such as a paper clip to press the Learn/Test button).

*
  * Press the button to transmit a learn code.
  * Press the button once to enter Test Mode for 3 minutes.

2. **Magnet**
   * Please refer to _**Magnet Scope Positioning**_ for how to use the magnet with the Door Contact correctly.

* _**LED Indicator**_

In Normal operation mode, the LED indicator remains off except in the following situations:

* When the Door Contact is activated under Low battery condition.
* When the Door Contact is activated and transmitting the signal under the Test mode.

**Features**

* _**Supervision**_
* The Door Contact will automatically transmit supervision signals to the Control Panel at random intervals of 30 to 50 minutes in Normal Operation Mode.
* If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Door Contact for a preset period time, the Control Panel will indicate that the Door Contact is experiencing an out-of-signal problem.
* _**Battery**_
* The Door Contact uses a pack of 10 x CR1616 battery as power source
* The Door Contact is also capable of detecting low battery condition. When the battery is low, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular transmission. The LED will light up when the Door Contact is activated under low battery status.

\<Note>

* The pre-inserted battery in the Slim Door Contact cannot be replaced or switched out.
* _**Test Mode**_
* The Door Contact can be put into Test mode for 3 minutes by pressing the Learn/Test Button once.
* During Test mode, the LED indicator will light up upon triggering.
* Each press on the Test Button will lead the Door Contact to transmit a test signal to the Control Panel for radio range test and reset the test mode to the 3-minute duration.
* The Door Contact will automatically exit Test Mode after the 3-minute duration and return to Normal Operation mode.

**Getting Started**

* _**Learning**_

**Step 1:** Put the Control Panel into learning mode, refer to the Control Panel manual for details.

**Step 2:** Press the Learn/Test Button on Door Contact to send signal to the Control Panel.

**Step 3:** If the Control Panel successfully receives the signal, the Control Panel will respond (e.g. emitting beeps). Refer to your Control Panel manual to complete the learning process.

**Step 4:** After the Door Contact is learnt-in, put the Control Panel into “**Walk Test**” mode, hold the Door Contact at the desired location, and press the Learn/Test button to confirm if this location is within signal range of the Control Panel.

**Step 5:** When you are satisfied that the Door Contact works at the chosen location, you may proceed to installation.

* _**Installation**_

**Step 1:** The mounting surface should be clean, dry, and smooth. Clean the mounting surface with

![](<.gitbook/assets/1 (8).jpeg>)a suitable degreaser if needed.

**Step 2:** Remove paper backing of the adhesive tape on the back of the Door Contact.

**Step 3:** Apply the Door Contact to the mounting surface, and press firmly for 30 seconds to ensure good contact.

**Step 4.** Remove the paper backing of the adhesive tape on the magnet

**Step 5.** Apply the magnet on a mobile object, e.g. the door/window, and press firmly for 30 seconds to ensure good contact. The magnet must be aligned with the Door Contact (Please refer to Magnet Scope Positioning below.)

\<Note>

* Do not apply the 3M adhesive tape on a surface with peeling or cracked paint, or on a rough surface.
* ![C:\Users\c0982\Desktop\影像\SDC-1\_0622\_03.png](<.gitbook/assets/2 (23).png>)The 3M adhesive tape cannot be reused.
* _**Magnet Scope Positioning**_
* The Learn/Test Button located on the front side of Door Contact is the main magnet detection area.
* The magnet detection area is polished for easy identification.
* The magnet should be no more than **15mm** from the detector when the door/window is closed.
* The magnet should be applied vertically parallel to the Door Contact as pictures shown below.
* When installing within a door / window slot (similar as image above), the window and window frame spacing should be greater than **5mm**, or the window cannot be properly closed.
