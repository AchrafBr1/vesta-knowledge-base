**1.2. Introduction**

BOGP-3 is a battery-operated cellular & GPRS alarm system. The LCD display and rubber keypad are convenient for programming and operation.

This manual covers the installation, programming, and control of the BOGP-3 control panel.

* BOGP-3 2G**:** battery-operated cellular & GPRS alarm system with 2G reporting.
* BOGP-3 4G**:** battery-operated cellular & GPRS alarm system with 4G reporting.

Remote programming of the panel is achieved by registering the panel in our **Home Portal Server**. With **Home Portal Server**, you can connect to your panel either with a computer or a smartphone using our Vesta Home application. Please refer to our Home Portal User Guide for detail about registering and using **Home Portal Server**.

**1.3. The Power Supply**

BOGP-3 Control Panel features completely wire-free operation that can use 4 Alkaline D batteries as power supply.

**1.4. System Deployment**

The Control Panel is designed to be wall mounted, follow guidelines below when planning installation location:

* The Control Panel should be installed at a location that is hidden from outside view.
* You can use the Control Panel‚Äôs built-in Keypad for entry control. In this case, install the Control Panel close to your main entrance.
* The Control Panel should be protected by sensors so that no intruder can reach the Control Panel without first activating sensor.
* **SIM card:**

The Control Panel features built-in 2G/4G communication facility to report to the Monitoring Station. To use the 2G/4G function, a SIM card is required.

**1.6. Multi-User Passwords**

In order to provide maximum security when operating the system, the Control Panel offers different levels of authorization for various situations.

**User PIN Code**

* The User Codes are used for users to access the alarm system for basic alarm system function. A total of 10 4-digit User Codes can be stored in the Control Panel. Each individual User can be given a name for easy recognition when viewing system events. User Names can be named when first setting them or by editing them afterwards when resetting them.
* User PIN code #1 is activated with ‚Äú**1234**‚Äù as factory default and cannot be deleted.
* User PIN code #2\~#10 are deactivated by factory default

* The Installer Code is for installer to program system configurations under installer menu, such as Tel. Number, Account Number.
* When the display panel asks for **I-Code**, please enter your Installer Code.
* Factory default: **7982**

**Guard Code**

* The Guard Code has the same level of authorization as the PIN Code. It is designed for security personnel to access the alarm system.

**Temporary Code**

* The Temporary Code is designed for the use of occasional visitors. It has the same authorization level as the User PIN Code, but will be removed after one arming and disarming action.

**Duress Code**

* The Duress Code is specially designed for situation when the user is under personal threat. It has the same level of authorization as User PIN Code, however when a Duress Code is entered, the Control Panel will send a silent alarm report to notify that the user is being threatened or held against his will.
