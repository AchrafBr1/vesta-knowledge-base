## **Outdoor Door Contact**&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

DC-32-EX is an outdoor door contact used to detect the opening and closure of outdoor gates, entries, exits and more. The Door Contact can also be placed on metal materials, while its powerful magnet can tolerate a wide gap to reduce false alarm.

The device also has the capabilities of communicating signal problems along with low battery conditions. The front and back tamper switches provide tamper protection against unauthorized device opening and removal.

The Door Contact has an extension terminal that can be connected to an existing wired device. When the connected device is triggered, the Door Contact will also be activated.

## _**LED Indicator**_

* In Normal Operation Mode, the LED will not light when the Door Contact is activated.
* When the Door Contact battery voltage is low, every time the Door Contact is activated (device opened/closed), the LED will flash.
* When any of the tamper switches is triggered, the LED will flash. When a tamper condition continues, the LED will flash whenever the Door Contact Is activated.
* When the Door Contact is in Test mode, the LED will flash every time it is activated.
* When the battery is exhausted, the Door Contact will stop all functions, and the LED will flash every 4 seconds.

## _**Battery**_

* The Door Contact uses two **AA L91 Lithium batteries** as its power source. Please note: **ALWAYS** replace batteries with the correct size and voltage.
* The Door Contact can detect the low battery condition. When the battery voltage is low, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel to notify of the condition. The LED will light up when the Door Contact is activated under the low battery condition. When the battery is exhausted, the Door Contact will stop all functions, and the LED will flash every 4 seconds.
* When changing batteries, after removing the old batteries, press the Tamper Switch twice to fully discharge before inserting new batteries.

## _**Tamper Protection**_

* The Door Contact is protected against any attempts to open the battery cover or to detach the device from its mounting surface.
* If the Door Contact detects a tamper condition of battery cover opening or device removal, a tamper signal will be sent to the Control Panel to remind the user of the condition.

## _**Supervisory Signal**_

* The Door Contact will automatically transmit Supervisory Signals periodically to the Control Panel at random intervals of 30-50 minutes.
* If the Control Panel has not received the signal from the Door Contact for a preset period of time, the Control Panel will indicate that the particular Door Contact is experiencing an out-of-signal problem.

## _**Test Mode**_

* Under Normal Mode, press the Test Button to transmit a test signal and learning code to the Control Panel. The Door Contact will also enter the Test Mode for 3 minutes.
* Under Test Mode, the LED will light up whenever the Door Contact is activated.
* Each additional Test Button press will reset Test Mode time to 3 minutes.

## _**Getting Started**_

* Insert a flat-head screwdriver into the slot and push upward to open the protective cover. (**Figure 1**)
* Remove the battery cover and insert batteries to power on the device.
* Put the Control Panel into Learning Mode (please refer to panel operation manual).
* Use a pointy tool to press the Door Contact learn button.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/1 (87).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 1</p></figcaption></figure>

* Refer to your Control Panel operation manual to complete the learn-in process.
* After the Door Contact is learned-in, place the Control Panel into **Walk Test** mode, hold the Door Contact in the desired location, and press the Test button to transmit test signal to the Control Panel. If the Control Panel is within Door Contact signal range, the panel will display door contact information accordingly.
* Replace the battery cover and proceed with mounting and installation once you are satisfied that the Door Contact location functions properly.

### _**Mounting Methods and Installation**_

* It is recommended that the Door Contact be placed on the fixed  &#x20;frame of a door/window, and the magnet on the door/window.
* The rib marks on the magnet and Door Contact must align.  \
  (Figure 2)

* The magnet should not be more than 3 cm from the marked side of the Door Contact when the door is closed.
* The door contact has a back tamper switch on its back cover. Ensure the device is positioned within the bracket so that the tamper switch spring is pressed against the breakaway area that is loosely connected to the bracket. If the door contact is forcibly removed from the wall, the breakaway area will break off from the bracket and remain attached to the mounting surface, activating the tamper switch.
* To mount the Door Contact

![Figure 3](<.gitbook/assets/3 (78).jpeg>)

1. The provided mounting bracket has 3 knockouts where the plastic is thinner and can be broken for mounting purpose. (**Figure 3**)
2. Use the mounting bracket as a template to drill holes on the wall for plugs. (**Figure 4**)
3. Push in the plugs and fix the mounting bracket on the wall with the screws.
4. Mount the Door Contact with the hooks on the back cover of the Door Contact latched on the latch holes of the mounting bracket, and then push downwards to lock the hook. (**Figure 5)**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

* Make sure the back tamper switch of the Door Contact is pressed against the breakaway area on the mounting bracket.
* Secure the bottom fixing screws.
{% endhint %}

5\) Re-place the protective cover.

* There are two ways to mount the magnet â€“ adhesive mounting and screw mounting.
  * Screw mounting:
    1. Screw the mounting bracket with the two supplied screws to the door.
    2. Attach the magnet to the mounting bracket.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

The magnet spacer provided can be used, by having the side with black words touch the mounting bracket, between the magnet and the door to facilitate alignment and installation.
{% endhint %}

* Adhesive mounting:
  1. Alternatively, use the double sided tape provided to directly attach the magnet to the door.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

Ensure that the mounting surface should be clean, dry, and smooth before attaching the magnet taped with the double sided tape to the door and that the magnet should be firmly pressed against the door for 30 seconds.
{% endhint %}

2. The installation is now complete.

## _**Using the Extension Terminal**_

* The Door Contact has an extension terminal to provide enhanced flexibility. The extension terminal forms a closed loop with the device connected to it. When the device is triggered, the loop will be opened; the Door Contact will also be triggered.
* The extension terminal and the internal magnetic switch can function together to trigger the Door Contact when either of them is activated.
* To connect the Door Contact with another device with the extension terminal:
  1. Perforate the rubber gasket at the back of the Door Contact with a 0.8mm pin.
  2. Pass the wires through the wiring hole and out the opposite side.
  3. Connect each wire to the relevant terminal.
  4. Tighten the screw to close the terminal and hold the wire in place.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

Use cable (AWG22-26) shorter than 3 M for this installation.

* The extension terminal may be useful for the following situation.
  * If the Door Contact cannot be mounted on the door frame, you can connect an additional extension switch to the extension terminal to mount the Door Contact remotely.
  * Any dry contact device with N.C. (Normal Close) loop can be connected to the extension terminal, making the Door Contact serve as an Universal Transmitter.
  * Multiple dry contact devices can be wired together with the Door Contact, as shown in the diagram below.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

* **If the internal magnet Switch and extension terminal operate together, then:**

When the protected door is opened/closed **or** the external device is triggered, the Door Contact activates and transmits a signal immediately .

However, the Door contact will only transmit a **Door Closed** or **Restored** signal after both the door **and** the external device are restored for 3 sec.
