## **Parts Identification**

**1.** **Learn/Test Button**

Use sharp tools such as paper clip to press the button and transmit Lear/Test code.

**2. LED Indicator**

The LED flashes when:

* The Learn/Test button is pressed.
* The sensor has detected shock/vibration.

## **Features**

### _**Battery and Low Battery Detection**_

* The Sensor uses one **CR2032 3V** Lithium battery as its power source. Please note: **ALWAYS** replace battery with the correct size and voltage.
* The battery is pre-inserted in the sensor. Pull out the battery insulator to activate battery.
* The Sensor can detect if the battery is low. When the Battery is low, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with regular transmission.
* When changing battery, use a sharp tool to open the battery slot to remove and insert battery.
* When inserting battery, the **positive(+)** side of the battery must face upward. **NEVER** insert the battery with negative(-) side facing upward.
* When the battery is inserted, the LED indicator will light up briefly.

### _**Supervision**_

The Sensor will transmit a supervision signal to report its condition regularly according to the user’s setting. The factory default interval is 30-40 minutes. The user can also press the Test Button once to transmit a supervision signal manually.

### _**Sensitivity**_

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only available for SVGS-5 or allowing for sensitivity
{% endhint %}

The Sensor can send alarm signal to the Control Panel according to different sensitivity levels setting. The sensitivity levels include high, medium, and low (default). The higher the sensitivity; the easier the sensor is triggered by shock/vibration.

To adjust the sensitivity setting:

1. Remove the battery.
2. Reinsert the battery, the LED indicator will light up briefly for about 1 second.
3. Press and hold the Learn/Test button when the LED indicator is lit up.
4. The LED will begin to flash 3 times:

&#x20;      I.  Release the button when the LED flash for the first time to set the sensitivity to Low.

&#x20;      II. Release the button when the LED flash for the second time to set sensitivity to Medium.

&#x20;      III. Release the button when the LED flash for the third time to set sensitivity to High.

* The detection range of different sensitivity varies depending on the mounting surface materials.

## **Learning and Installation**

### _**Learning**_

1. Pull out the battery insulator power on the sensor.
2. Refer to Control Panel manual to put panel into learning mode.
3. Press the Learn/Test button once to transmit learn code.
4. Refer to your Control Panel operation manual to complete the learn-in process.

### _**Installation Steps**_

1. Before installation, put the sensor at desired mounting location.
2. Put the Control Panel into Walk Test mode
3. Press the Learn/Test button once to transmit signal for Walk Test. Proceed with installation if signal strength is satisfactory, otherwise relocate the sensor or Control Panel and repeat Walk Test.
4. Adjust the sensor’s sensitivity as desired according to the table in previous section.
5. Determine the mounting location on window or wall. The sensor may be mounted at the center of or at the corner. If one sensor is unable to cover the entire surface, use multiple sensors.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

When mounting at corner, make sure to keep at least 10mm distance between the sensor and the edge of window or wall. Adjust the battery slot direction (**Do not face the corner**) to avoid difficulty when removing the battery slot.

6. Clean and dry the mounting location. Do not install on dirty or web surface.
7. Use the provided double-sided adhesive tape (Ø35mm x 8mm) to apply to the back cover of SVGS-1 and stick the  sensor onto window/wall.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:&#x20;

Please do not apply the double-sided adhesive tape to the front cover where Test Button and LED indicator are located, and do not apply the tape twice.
{% endhint %}

### _**Installation Guideline**_

* Always make sure to test the detection range after installation.
* The adhesive tape may become loose from exposure to sunlight. Make sure to check the sensor at least once every 6 months.
* Avoid mounting at location prone to shaking or vibration, which will cause false alarm.
* When mounted on plywood:

&#x20;         1 Use only High sensitivity setting.

&#x20;         2 Mounting on wall next to large furniture may affect the sensor’s detection range and signal  transmission range. Make sure to test the sensor if chosen to mount at such location.

* Sensor detection range is affected by double-side adhesive tape size and material. The sensitivity-range table provided in this document is tested with factory provided adhesive tape. If different adhesive tape is used, make sure to retest the detection range.
