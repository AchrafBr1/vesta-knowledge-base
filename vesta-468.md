## Features

### Battery

* The Smoke Detector uses CR123 3V Lithium batteries in parallel connection as power source. Up to 3 batteries can be inserted in the battery compartment.
* When low battery status is detected, the Smoke Detector will transmit a low battery signal and enter low battery status.
* When low battery, a low battery signal will be transmitted along with regular signal transmissions; the Orange LED will flash once along with one beep every 45 seconds.

You can press the test button to silent the beep for 7 days. This action can only be performed once, if the battery is not changed, the beep will resume after 7 days and cannot be silenced again.

* The Red and Orange LEDs will both flash every 4 seconds when the batteries are exhausted.
* When changing the batteries, press the Test Button twice to fully discharge the residual power after removing the old batteries before inserting new ones.

### Getting Started

**Step 1** Insert CR123 3V Lithium batteries to power on the Smoke Detector. Orient the batteries according to the polarity indicated in the battery compartment before insertion.

**Step 2** The Smoke Detector will emit 2 short beeps and begin **warming up for 1 minute**. The Red LED will flash every 2 seconds.

**Step 3** When the warm-up is complete, the Smoke Detector will emit a beep to indicate it has entered calibration mode. The **calibration** mode lasts for 1 minute. The Red LED will continue to flash every two seconds during calibration. If calibration fails, the smoke detector will retry calibration and calibration mode will last a maximum of 9 minutes. If calibration cannot be completed in 9 minutes, the Smoke Detector will emit continuous beep. Remove the battery and restart from Step 1.

**Step 4** When calibration is completed, the Smoke Detector will emit 2 short beeps and turn off LED, returning to normal mode.

**Step 5** Put Control Panel into learning mode. Refer to Control Panel manual for details.

**Step 6 (For non-SC model)** Press the Learn/Test Button once to transmit learning code.

(For SC model) Press the Learn/Test Button for 3 seconds to transmit learn code.&#x20;

**Step 7** Refer to Control Panel manual to complete learning process. For SC model, the Smoke Detector will emit a 2-tone beep to indicate successful learning.

### Edit Device Operation Area

Use the “Device Edit” function on the Panel’s webpage to change the area settings.

* **For non-SC models,** the setting is completed after clicking OK.
* **For SC models,** press and hold the Learn/Test Button for 3 seconds to receive updated setting from the Control Panel

### Testing the Smoke Detector

By pressing the Test Button on the Smoke Detector, you can test if the Smoke Detector is functioning normally.

* If the Smoke Detector functions normally, the Red LED will flash briefly followed by a 2-tone beep.
* If the buzzer sounds 2-tone beeps 3 times, the “**Optical Chamber**” on the Smoke Detector is either dirty or out-of-order.

### Dust Accumulation Detection

* The detector regularly checks for excessive dust buildup inside the Optical Chamber.
* If the chamber accumulates must dust, the detector will report to the Panel to notify the user to clean it.
* If the chamber is still not cleaned and gets too much dust that it doesn't work anymore, the detector will report to the Panel for maintenance warning.

### _**Test Mode for IR Function**_**(SD-32-HM/-HM-SC/-HME-SC only)**

* The device’s PIR Motion Sensor can be put into Test mode by pressing the Test Button. Every time the Test Button is pressed, the device will transmit a test signal to the Control Panel for radio range test and enter the test mode for 3 mins. It will exit Test Mode automatically after 3 minutes and return to normal mode. In Test mode, the sleep timer is disabled, and the LED indicator will flash every time a movement is detected.

### _**Sleep Timer of IR Function**_**(SD-32-HM/-HM-SC/-HME-SC only)**

* The PIR Motion Sensor enters a **1-minute sleep mode**after detecting and transmitting movement to conserve power. During this time, it will not retransmit movements, preventing battery drain from continuous motion.

### Supervision

* The Smoke Detector is supervised by sending a periodic supervision signal to the Control Panel. When the Control Panel does not receive the supervision signal within the preprogrammed period, it will indicate a fault.

### _**Temperature Detection**_**(SD-32-H/-H-SC/-HM/-HM-SC/-HE-SC/-HME-SC only)**

* The Temperature Sensor measures temperature every 10 seconds, and transmits temperature reading to the Control Panel every 30\~33 minutes.
* Users can also press the Test Button once to transmit current temperature reading manually.

### Tamper Protection

 The Smoke Detector is protected by a tamper switch which is compressed when the Smoke Detector is installed on the mounting bracket. When the Smoke Detector is no longer attached to the mounting bracket, the tamper switch will be activated and a tamper open signal will be transmitted to the Control Panel

### Alarm Activation

The Smoke Detector will activate the fire alarm when smoke is detected. The models with heat detection will also activate the alarm when high heat is detected. When the alarm is activated, the Detector will transmit an alarm signal and sound its buzzer.

#### **Smoke Detection**

* The Smoke Detector checks smoke concentration every 8 seconds
* The alarm is activated whenever the smoke concentration exceeds the detection threshold, and will continue until the smoke concentration drops below alarm threshold.
* The Red LED will flash quickly during alarm.

#### **Heat Detection**

* The Smoke Detector’s built-in heat sensors enable its to raise alarm when high heat is detected. An alarm will be triggered when the temperature reaches 54∘\~ 65∘C.
* The Red LED will flash every second during alarm.
* The Smoke Detector will stop the alarm when the temperature drops below 49.5∘C.
* If the alarm is not triggered again for 160 seconds, the Smoke Detector will transmit a restore signal.
* If the alarm condition persists, the Smoke Detector will resend an alarm signal every 2 minutes.

**IR Detection (SD-32-HM/-HM-SC/-HME-SC only)**

* The Smoke Detector will transmit a signal to the Control Panel if any movement is detected within the IR detection coverage. The buzzer will not sound, and the LED will not flash. Please refer to your Control Panel for further details.

### Alarm Activation from the System (For SC models only)

The Smoke Detector can be programmed to sound **Burglar Alarm**, **Panic Alarm** and **CO Alarm** when triggered by the system, the alarm may be activated by other sensors in the system, or by Home Automation rules.

#### **Burglar / Panic Alarm**

* The Smoke Detector will apply the Control Panel’s alarm duration setting as default when it is learned in.
* The alarm duration can be configured via the Smoke Detector device settings on Home Portal Server.

### _**Emergency Light**_**&#x20;(SD-32-HE-SC/-HME-SC only)\_\_**

* The Smoke Detector has a built-in emergency light that can provide visual alerts in case of emergency. When the Smoke Detector is activated, the emergency light will turn on to indicate the system is alarming.

### _**Interconnection**_**(SC models only)\_\_**

* The Smoke Detector is interconnected with other Smoke Detectors in the alarm system. When one Smoke Detector triggers an alarm, the Control Panel will notify all interconnected Smoke Detectors to also raise their alarms, even if they have not detected smoke.
* To stop the alarm:
  * Wait for the smoke concentration to drop below the alarm threshold, or
  * Press the Test Button on the triggered Smoke Detector. This will also stop all interconnected Smoke Detectors.

![](<.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (8)>) _Pressing the Test Button on any other smoke detector will only stop the alarm of that specific unit; it will not silence the alarms across the entire system._

* **(For Security System only)** Disarming the system will stop alarms activated by the Control Panel on all interconnected Smoke Detectors. However, the originally triggered Smoke Detector will continue alarming until the smoke concentration falls below the threshold or its Test Button is pressed to silence its alarm.

### Alarm Silence

* When the Smoke Detector is alarming, pressing the Test Button will put the Smoke Detector into Alarm Silence mode to silence the alarm for 9 minutes. The buzzer will only stop sounding after the alarm has been activated for at least 1-minute. If the button is pressed before alarm time reaches 1 minute, the Smoke Detector will wait until alarm time has reached 1 minute before silencing the alarm.
* During the 9-minute Alarm Silence period, the Red LED will flash once per second. The Smoke Detector will continue to monitor smoke concentration during the alarm silence period.
* After the 9-minute Alarm Silence period has expired, if the smoke concentration has dropped below the alarm threshold, the Smoke Detector will emit a 2-tone beep and return to normal operation without sounding the alarm.
* If smoke concentration still exceeds alarm threshold, the Smoke Detector will start alarming again.
* If smoke concentration continues to rise during the Alarm Silence period and exceeds a second alarm threshold, the Smoke Detector will start alarming again. An alarm activated by exceeding the second alarm threshold cannot be silenced by pressing the Test Button.

### Auto-Calibration

* After the first installation, the Smoke Detector will perform auto-calibration after 12 hours. Subsequently, it will perform auto-calibration once every 15 days. During the auto-calibration process, the Smoke Detector will not emit any sounds, and the red LED will flash once every 2 seconds for about 50 seconds.
* If the auto-calibration fails, the orange LED will flash every second and the Smoke Detector will send a calibration failure code to the Control Panel. To recalibrate the Smoke Detector, remove and reload the batteries, or manually restart the calibration process.

_**\[NOTE]**&#x57;hen the Smoke Detector’s auto-calibration fails, the smoke alarm function will still work normally using the threshold value taken from the last successful calibration._

### Recalibration

As the operation condition of the Smoke Detector may vary after being installed for some time, you may wish to recalibrate the Smoke Detector to take a new smoke detection threshold value and ensure optimal performance of the Smoke Detector. To do this:

* Press and hold the Test Button for 10 seconds and release when the Smoke Detector emits 2 beeps. The device will sound another beep after 5 seconds and begin calibration. The Red LED will flash every 2 seconds to indicate.
* Calibration process lasts for **1 minute** (If calibration fails, the smoke detector will retry calibration, calibration mode will last up to 9 minutes.
* When calibration is finished, the Smoke Detector will sound a two-tone beep. The Red LED will stop flashing.
* If calibration fails, the Smoke Detector will beep continuously, and the Orange LED will flash every second. Please remove the battery, press the Test Button twice to fully discharge, and then reinsert the batteries to restart Smoke Detector.

## Maintenance & Cleaning

### Smoke Detection Installation Guidelines

 It is recommended that the installation site be in the center area of the ceiling.

<mark style="color:red;">LOCATIONS TO AVOID:</mark>

* The Kitchen – Smoke from cooking might cause an unwanted alarm.
* Near a ventilating fan, florescent lamp or air-conditioning equipment – air drafts from them may affect the device sensitivity.
* Near ceiling beams or over a cabinet – stagnant air in these areas may affect the device sensitivity.
* In the peak of an “A” frame type of ceiling.
* In or near insect-attracting areas, such as trash cans, plants, or humid areas, as insects may interfere with the Detector’s operation or trigger false alarms.

### IR Detection Installation Guidelines (SD-32-HM/-HM-SC/-HME-SC only)

* **It is recommended to install the Smoke Detector in the following locations.**
  * In a ceiling area with full view of its detection coverage unobstructed by appliances and furniture.
  * Near the entrance of a room or house to monitor entry activity.
* **Limitations**
  * Do not expose the Smoke Detector to direct sunlight.
  * Avoid installing the Smoke Detector in areas where machines such as air conditioners or heaters may cause rapid change in temperature in the detection area.
  * Avoid large obstacles in the detection area.
  * Do not aim directly at sources of heat, e.g., fires or boilers, and not above radiators.
  * Avoid moving objects, e.g., curtains, wall hangings, etc., in the detection area.
* Press the Test Button to enter Test Mode. Walk around the protected area noting when the LED lights up and check that the detection coverage is adequate.
* When detection coverage is confirmed to be satisfying, installation is now completed.

### Mounting the Smoke Detector
