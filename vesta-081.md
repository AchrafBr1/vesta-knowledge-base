**Voice Reach Talking Pendant (WTRVS-15-FS)**

WTRVS-15-FS is a small and lightweight Voice Reach Talking Pendant with a built-in fall sensor. The pendant allows immediate post-alarm voice follow up after an emergency call or fall detection. With a simple press of the button or after a fall detection, it can open two-way voice communication channel between the user and the Central Monitoring Station.

The Voice Reach Talking Pendant provides high-clarity two-way communication via Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) protocol. The device also has power saving feature for the panel by adopting RF technology to transmit periodic supervisory signals and low battery signal and to the Panel.

1. **Learning**

Step 1. Please refer to the Control Panel manual and put the Control Panel into **Learning Mode**.

Step 2. Press and hold the Active Button for 8 seconds until you hear a long beep. The LED will turn on orange and the Talking Pendant will emit 1 long beep to indicate it is now in learning mode. Wait for a short time to complete learning.

Step 3. If learning is successful, the Green LED will turn on 3 seconds and the pendant will emit 2 beeps.

If learning fails, the LED will dim and the pendant will emit 1 long beep.

Step 4. Refer to Control Panel manual to complete learning process.

**IV. Battery**

* The Talking Pendant uses one CR123 3V lithium battery as its power source.
* The Talking Pendant will automatically check its battery condition every 24 hours. If low battery voltage is detected, a low battery signal will be sent to the Control Panel along with Supervisory Signals every 30 to 50 minutes.

**To Change Battery:**

**Step 1:** Remove the battery compartment cover.

**Step 2:** Remove the old battery by pulling the black strip.

**Step 3:** Press the Active Button a couple times to discharge.

**Step 4:** When inserting the new battery, keep it parallel to the battery compartment. Do not tilt the battery, and please observe the correct polarity.

**Step 5:** The black strip should be pressed under the battery when battery is inserted.

**Step 6:** Replace the battery compartment cover.

1. **Supervision**
   * The Talking Pendant will automatically transmit Supervisory Signals to the Control Panel every 30 to 50 minutes.

**VI. Usage Recommendation for Fall Detection**

* Best way to wear a fall sensor **(O)**
  1. Let it hang in front of the chest and adjust necklace length so that the sensor hangs at the bottom of the sternum as shown in the picture below.
  2. Wear the pendant exposed outside and in front of any clothes or heavy/feather jacket.

C. When a fall occurs, it is best if the fall sensor can touch the ground.

3

* Wrong way to wear a fall sensor **(X)**
  1. Necklace being too short (around clavicle) or too long (below sternum) is likely to cause false trigger or no response.
  2. Fall sensor being worn inside a chest pocket will lead to non-detected condition.
* Carefully place the pendant on a desk when you are not using it in order to avoid triggering a false alarm.
* If WTRVS-15-FS remains stationary for more than 3 hours, it will enter Sleep Mode. If movement is detected during sleep mode, WTRVS-15-FS will start a 1-minute countdown to return to normal operation mode. Fall detection function is disabled during the 1-minute timer, and the user is allowed to put on the Fall Sensor again after removing it without activating false alarm. When the 1-minute timer expires, WTRVS-15-FS will return to normal operation.
* Due to the nature of fall detection mechanism, fall detection cannot be 100% accurate. False alarm or detection failure during daily use could not be avoided completely. Please utilize the Active Button to activate alarm manually when needed to ensure safety.
