_**2.Power Supply**_

The VDP uses 12\~24V DC or 16\~24V AC power as its power source. Please refer to **2.3. The Power Supply** for more details of connecting to Power Supply.

_**3.Hardware Installation**_

**Step 1.**

Switch off the circuit breaker first. Take out the VDP from package and remove the protective cover. Loosen the 4 screws on the back of the VDP. Connect wires to the inputs as shown in Figure 1. If door lock is used, also connect the door lock. It is recommended to use wire with a diameter less than 15mm to connect the power input. Please note that torque on the screw should be less than 24.5Nm (2.5kg-m).

**Step 2.**

Locate the 2 mounting holes on the VDP as shown in Figure 2, and screw the VDP into the wall. Replace the protective cover on top of the VDP, and tighten the cover fixing screw. Switch on the circuit breaker to provide power to the VDP.

_**4.Installation of Bracket and Protective Case**_

**Mounting with Bracket and Protective Case**

Three optional brackets are provided, which allows users to angle the VDP device at three different degrees: 20°, 30° and 40°.

Using the bracket can enhance the view and capture the approaching subjects more accurately.

A protective case is provided to be used with the bracket to shield the VDP from the sun and rain.

Follow the steps below to mount VDP-3 with bracket and protective case.

**Step 1.**

First, choose the mounting bracket with desired angle. Fix it onto the wall by fastening two screws through two mounting holes.

**Step 2.**

Attach the protective case directly onto the mounting bracket. Be sure that the latching holes on the protective cases must lock firmly onto the corresponding latches on the mounting bracket.

**Step 3.**

Place the VDP-3 onto the protective case combined with the angling bracket, and push to secure. Fasten the two screws through the mounting holes on VDP to secure.

| **Step 4.**                          | VDP-3 |   |

| Replace the cover on top of the VDP. |       |   |
| **Mounting with Protective Case**    |       |   |

|                 | Mounting Bracket |   |
| --------------- | ---------------- | - |
| Protective Case | (20°/30°/40°)    |   |
|                 |                  |   |

You may also choose to install the VDP-3 onto the wall with protective case, but without the angling bracket.

Follow the steps below to mount VDP-3 with protective case.

**Step 1.**

Place the VDP-3 onto the protective case. Then, fasten the two screws through the mounting holes on the VDP-3 and the protective case to secure them onto the wall.

**Step 2.**

Replace the protective cover on top of the VDP-3.
