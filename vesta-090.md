### _**Watch Crown**_

* Pull out the watch crown, situated on the side of the case at the 3 o’clock mark, to adjust time. Please note: Don’t wear your watch in the shower.

### _**Active Button**_

* Press and hold the Active Button for more than one sec will activate the Control Panel. The LED will flash three times for F1 frequencies as default, while the LED will turn on for 2 seconds for 868NF as default. It will then transmit an emergency signal to the Control Panel for it to respond accordingly.
* Press and hold the Active Button for 8 seconds to send a Cancel Code to the Control Panel. (This function is not compatible with every control panel).

## _**Learn In Care Watch**_

Step 1. Put the Control Panel into **Learning Mode**.

Step 2. Press the Active Button on the Care Watch, a radio signal will be transmitted to the Control Panel.

Step 3. Please refer to the operation manual of your control panel to complete the process.

## _**Battery**_

The RF transmitter uses a CR2016 3V Lithium battery as its power source, while the watch itself uses a SR621SW battery as its power source.

Every time the Active Button is pressed, the Care Watch will check the battery voltage. If low battery is detected for 3 times successively, the Care Watch will enter low battery status and transmit Low Battery signal along with regular signal every time the button is pressed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:

A 30-second interval is required between each Active Button press to check the battery voltage again.
{% endhint %}

## _**Auto Low Battery Detection**_

The Care Watch features Auto Low Battery detection function.

* The Care Watch will automatically check battery voltage every 20-24 hours. If low battery is detected for 3 times successively, the Care Watch will enter low battery status and transmitted low battery signal every 12 hours.

## _**Changing Battery**_

* The CW-1 is powered by two batteries, one is for RF transmitter and the other is for the watch itself. Please note that the component is delicate, the replacement of battery shall be performed by a watchmaker or a horologist only to avoid damaging the watch.

**Step 1.** Place the watch upside-down on a soft piece of cloth to protect the surface from scratches (Figure 1).

**Step 2.** Use a slotted screwdriver to pry up the watch back. (For metal cover only) The pry-off watch back has a small indentation at the top right corner where a slotted screwdriver blade can be inserted to pop off the watch back, as shown below **(Figure 2).**

**Step 3.** Remove the watch back and save it for later use. To replace the battery of the RF transmitter, use tweezers to remove the old battery. Just work one end of the tweezers under the battery and gently pry it off **(Figure 3)**.

**Step 4.** After the old battery is removed, replace it with a new CR2016 3V lithium battery with the positive side (+) facing upwards.

**Step 5.** To replace the battery of the watch itself, use tweezers to pick up the PCB board and put it aside for later use **(Figure 4)**.

**Step 6.** Use tweezers to remove the old battery. Just work one end of the tweezers under the battery and gently pry it off **(Figure 5)**

**Step 7.** After the old battery is removed, replace it with a new SR621SW battery with the positive side (+) facing upwards.

**Step 8.** Replace the PCB board, which has two pre-drilled holes for easy installation **(Figure 6)**.&#x20;

**Step 9.** Locate the Active Button at the bottom left corner. Ensure it is on the left-hand side when the

PCB board is replaced **(Figure 7)**.
