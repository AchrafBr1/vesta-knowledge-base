**Introduction**

The PWB-1-BUS is an auxiliary power supply module designed for integration into the BUS system, providing a maximum of 13.5V, 3A power supply to connected BUS devices.

When connected to the Hybrid Panel, the PWB-1-BUS module is supervised by and communicates to the Panel all the status changes, including AC power status, battery level, tamper status, and energy consumption data. Moreover, the PWB-1-BUS features voltage detection of the Hybrid Panel BUS VDD terminal. Only when the Hybrid Panel operates normally with power supplied at the BUS output will PWB-1-BUS supply power to connected BUS devices.

## **Identifying the Parts**

1. **BUS Connection Terminals to the Hybrid Panel** (4 wire: V, G, A, B)
2. **BUS Connection Terminals to powered BUS device** (4 wire: V, G, A, B)
3. **BUS Connection Terminals to powered BUS device** (4 wire: V, G, A, B)
4. **Battery Switch**

Slide the battery switch to ON position, so that the backup battery will be charged when the AC power is connected and serve as a backup power source when AC power is missing.

5. **Battery Terminal**

For the backup battery (One 12V 7.0Ah or 12V 17.2Ah Sealed Lead-acid battery)

6. **Terminal Resistor Jumper Switch (J3)**

When the power supply module is connected in the BUS line as the furthest BUS device from the Hybrid Panel, please set both the Terminal Resistor Jumpers of the power supply module and the Hybrid Panel to ON. The BUS line’s communication ability will be enhanced

* The Terminal Resistor Jumper of PWB-1-BUS is usually used when the power supply module is first connected to the Hybrid Panel without any powered BUS devices connected.
* You can set he power supply module’s Terminal Resistor Jumper and the Hybrid Panel’s Terminal Resistor Jumper to ON to test if PWB-1-BUS can communicate well with the Panel.
* If communication with the Panel is tested OK, you can start connecting the PWB-1-BUS to the powered devices. Then please set the power supply module’s Terminal Resistor Jumper to off, and set the Terminal Resistor Jumper of the farthest device in the BUS line to ON instead.

If the jumper is OFF (the jumper link is removed or “parked” on one pin), the communication ability is in normal level.

If the jumper is ON (the jumper link rests on both pins), the communication ability is enhanced.

## **Power Supply**

_**Power Source**_**:**

* The PWB-1-BUS is connected to 20Vac 50Hz/60Hz, 4A (80VA) power supply.
* When power supply is interrupted and then restore, PWB-1-BUS will transmit an AC failure and an AC restore signal respectively.

_**Rechargeable Battery**_**:**

* A 12V 7.0Ah or 12V 17.2Ah Sealed Lead-acid battery can be connected to serve as a backup in case of a power failure.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note:

* The Auxiliary Power Supply Module will be activated only when it is powered by the AC power first. If PWB-1-BUS is first powered by the rechargeable battery, it will not be activated.
* During normal operation, the AC power is used to supply power to PWB-1-BUS and at the same time recharge the battery. It takes approximately 48 hours to fully charge a 12V 7.0Ah battery, and 72 hours to fully charge a 12V 17.2Ah battery.
* If the battery switch is set as OFF, the battery will not be charged when the AC power is connected and nor will it serve as a backup power source when the AC power is missing. You need to switch the battery to **ON** for it to be charged when the AC power is connected and serve as a backup power source when the AC power is missing.
* When the battery is low in power, PWB-1-BUS will transmit a low battery signal. When the battery has been charged, PWB-1-BUS will transmit a battery restore signal.
* When the battery is disconnected, battery switch is off, or battery failure is detected, PWB-1-BUS will report battery missing/dead to the Control Panel.
{% endhint %}

## _**Power Output**_**:**

* PWB-1-BUS can supply a maximum of 13.5V, 3A power to the connected BUS devices.
* Through connection to the Hybrid Panel's BUS VDD terminal, PWB-1-BUS can detect if the Panel operates normally with power supplied at the BUS output. Only when PWB-1-BUS is properly connected to the Panel and confirms the Panel’s normal operation will PWB-1-BUS supply power to connected BUS devices.

## **Tamper Protection**

Two Tamper Switch Terminals are provided: one for the door tamper switch and the other for the wall-mount tamper switch on the enclosure.

The Tamper Switches for door and wall-mount are in a normal position when the door is closed and the enclosure is securely mounted on the wall. Tamper violation happens when the door is opened or the enclosure is detached from the wall, causing the Tamper Switch to activate (Tamper Opened). A tamper open/close alert will be reported to the Control Panel.
