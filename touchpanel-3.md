Moreover, TouchPanel-3 features two-way hands-free communication through the built-in speaker and microphone.

Other innovative features include Bluetooth disarming, which allows users to conveniently disarm the security system even with their hands full. The face detection function enables the front camera to take photos when someone disarms the system, providing the basis for algorithm analysis to prevent potential harms.

#### System Feature

* **Two-way voice communication with VOIP and 4G/LTE**: Built-in microphone and speaker allows user to make hands-free voice call in case of emergency.

Additionally, TouchPanel-3 automatically answers a callback call during callback timer.

* **Ethernet, WiFi, and/or 4G/LTE connection**:

The system can be connected through Ethernet, WiFi, or 4G/LTE. When all the three connection methods are available, the Panel prioritizes its connections in the following order: Ethernet > WiFi > 4G/LTE.

WiFi connection provides backup to Ethernet to extend system flexibility.

* **Voice Prompt Reminder**: The panel plays voice prompts upon system mode change to remind user the system status.
* **AI Recognition for alarm pictures:** The panel incorporates an AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm for recognizing whether an alarm image contains a person. Alarm images, along with the AI detection results, are transmitted to the CMS, enabling the CMS to prioritize the new alarm queue based on this AI detection.
* **Screen Timeout**: By default, the screen of TouchPanel-3 will automatically turn off after 5 minutes of inactivity. Tap anywhere on the screen to turn it on.

The user can also select the screen timeout period in Settings. If "Never" is selected, the screen will always stay on. Please refer to _**5. Settings**_.

#### 2.3. Power Supply

**Power Adapter**

* A DC 5 V 3 A USB-C switching power adapter is required to connect to a wall outlet. Be sure only to use an adapter with the appropriate AC voltage rating to prevent component damage.
* TouchPanel-3 will automatically turn on after AC power is supplied.

**Rechargeable Battery**

* In addition to the adapter, there is a rechargeable battery inside the Control Panel, which serves as a backup power in case of a power failure.
* During normal operation, the AC power adapter is used to supply power to the Control Panel and at the same time recharge the battery.
* When the adapter is disconnected from the Control Panel, the Red LED will turn on to indicate AC power loss.
* When the battery level is low, TouchPanel-3 will report a low battery status. If the AC power adapter is not reconnected after this report and the battery continues to drain, a warning message will appear on the user interface. If the battery becomes too low for the system to function, it will automatically shut down to protect data.

**Auxiliary Power Supply Accessory (Optional)**

* In addition to the standard power adapter, TouchPanel-3 can also be powered using one of the following optional power supplies:
  * **AUX-PS:** An AC power board that converts 100–240 VAC, 50/60 Hz input into a regulated 5 V DC / 3 A output. The AUX-PS must be connected to a wall outlet (mains socket).
  * **AUX-PS-DC:** A DC power board that converts 7-36 V DC input into a regulated 5 V DC / 3 A output. The AUX-PS-DC should be connected to a regulated DC power source (e.g., a power supply unit (PSU)).
* To use the Power Supply Accessory (AUX-PS or AUX-PS-DC):
  1. Connect the USB-C connector of the AUX-PS or AUX-PS-DC to the USB-C Port on TouchPanel-3.
  2. For **AUX-PS**, connect the two wires of the AC power cable to the power input terminals on AUX-PS, then plug the cable into a 100–240 VAC mains outlet.

**Panel Settings**

* **AC Fail Report**: When an AC power failure is detected, your Control Panel will report to the Central Monitoring Station according to the duration set under AC Fail Report. If 5 minutes is set, the event will be automatically reported to the CMS after 5 minutes. Your Control Panel will then be powered by the backup battery until the fault is cleared.
* **Jamming Report**: Jamming period is specified as background RSSI level detected exceeds the threshold for a duration. The jamming period detected will be accumulated.

3 options, Disable, 1 minute, and 2 minutes, are provided. If 1 minute is set, once the total jamming period exceeds 30 seconds within 1 minute, a “Jamming” message will be reported to the Central Monitoring Station. If 2 minutes is set, once the total jamming period exceeds 60 seconds within 2 minutes, a “Jamming” message will be reported. If Diable is set, the Panel will not send a jamming report when detecting a jamming fault.

* **Auto Check-in Interval**:**Select whether the Control Panel needs to send check-in reporting to the Central Station automatically and to select the interval between check-in reports. Options available are Disable, 1 hour**,\*\* 2 hours\*\*,\*\* 3 hours… up to 4 Weeks\*\*.
* **Auto Check-in Offset Period**:\*\*\*\*Set the time delay before the first **Auto Check-In** report is made. After power is supplied or re-supplied to the Control Panel, a test report will be sent to the Central Monitoring Station (CMS) based on the Offset Period. This is used to test whether the CMS can receive the report from the Panel successfully.

After this test report is sent, the Control Panel will then send reports at regular interval based on the setting of the Auto Check-in Report.

For example, if **Offset** **Period** is set to 2 Hours, and **Auto Check-in Report** is set to 12 hours, the Control Panel will transmit an event code 602 to the CMS after 2 hours, and then report event 602 periodically at a regular interval of 12 hours.

* If reporting to the first destination in a group fails, the system will move on to the next report destination in the group.
* If reporting to one of the report destinations in a group is successful, the system will consider reporting to this group successful and stop reporting to rest of the destinations in the group. It will then move on to report to the next group.
* If reporting to all destinations in a group fails, the system will retry report to group according to retry times set below. If reporting is still unsuccessful after retries, the system will move on to report the the next group according to Essential/Optional setting below.
* After completing a round of reporting (From Group 1  Group 2 ….. Group5), If there is any group set as Essential which has not received report successfully, the system will restart the reporting cycle to retry reporting until every group set as Essential is reported successfully.

 **Essential/Optional:**

* Essential: the system will report to all groups set as **Essential**. The system will never give up trying to report to any group set as Essential until at least one of the destinations in every Essential group successfully receives the report. Group 1 is always set as **Essential** and cannot be changed.
* Optional: The system will only report to group set as **Optional**when reporting to its previous group fails. For example: if Group 3 is set is optional, the Control Panel will only report to Group 3 if reporting to Group 2 fails.

 **Retry:** If reporting to all destinations in a group fails, the system will retry reporting to the group according to the retries times set here.

Also, go to your smartphone’s **Bluetooth** settings and verify that TouchPanel-3

(**TPxxxxxx**, where xxxxxx is the last 6 digits of the panel’s MAC address) is listed as a paired device.

It is normal for TouchPanel-3 to show as "Not Connected" on your smartphone, as the system only searches for nearby Bluetooth devices when in **Away Arm Mode**.

**Disarming the System via Smartphone**

To disarm the system via a paired smartphone:

 When the system is away armed, approach TouchPanel-3 with the paired smartphone. Once TouchPanel-3 detects the paired smartphone within the BLE range, the system will automatically disarm.

_**Note:**_

* The smartphone’s Bluetooth function needs to be turned ON. The effective BLE range may differ depending on different mobile devices.
* After the system arms, **a 30-second buffer** is configured for the paired mobile to be out of TouchPanel-3 BLE range. TouchPanel-3 will start detecting only after the system is armed for 30 seconds. If the paired mobile is within the BLE range when the system arms, the system will **not** Disarm\*\* until the 30-second buffer passes.\*\*

**Edit User PIN Code for the paired Smartphone**

Go to **Bluetooth Disarming** setting page to access a list of paired devices. Tap the Edit icon ![](<.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (32)>)at the device row to enter **Set User PIN** page. Input the corresponding User PIN for applicable area(s), then tap Submit.
